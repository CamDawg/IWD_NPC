Though he has spent several years in the vicinity of Easthaven, Korin originally hails from Evereska, an elven stronghold in the northern Faerun.  He does not look especially suited for the harsh, demanding trade of the ranger, and when asked directly, he confirms it, saying he hoped to dedicate himself to the finer arts.  There is a brittle edge to his words, soon to be replaced by a genuine smile: judging by his explanation, he spent several years in exile, and is grateful for any company.  He speaks about helpful, unobtrusive folk of the Dale with much warmth in his voice, and is seemingly reluctant to leave the shores of Lac Dinneshere.
