Severn comes from the vast farmsteads stretching along the Sword Coast.  Always ready to drop in an unexpected joke or to whistle a long-forgotten tune, he ruefully admits his lack of talents, and adds that like many before him, he came to the Spine of the World to seek inspiration.  He left Baldur's Gate a few months ago due to an embarrassing performance he promises to tell about some time.  Judging by the state of his attire, his money is running out, and Severn confirms this, saying he vowed to join the first adventuring company that would take him.  A wooden flute is his only worldly possession, but he looks to the future with optimism.
