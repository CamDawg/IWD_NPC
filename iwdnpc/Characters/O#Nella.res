Born in Bryn Shander to the family of travelling merchants, Nella was shaping up to be a caravan guard, until one day, her parents brought her to Kuldahar.  There, she says, her real life started: Arundel, the Archdruid, recognized her healing skills.  With the permission of her parents, which, she recalls, involved a hefty sum of gold, he took her away and started to train her in the druidic rites and spiritual traditions.  More often than not, however, she was sent off to various fighting missions.  The last one took her to Easthaven.
