A quiet, fair-spoken young man, he speaks little unless addressed directly.  When asked about his past, Holvir explains that he comes from the City of Splendors, having been summoned by his superior's old friend, Hrothgar.  A knight of the Order of the Knights of Holy Judgement, he has dedicated his whole life to Tyr at an early age, and has been made a full paladin a little more than a year ago.  He remains alert and looks ready to provide aid at all times, though his general conduct is a little aloof.
