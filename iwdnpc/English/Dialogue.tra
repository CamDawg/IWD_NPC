@0    = ~So, as we are in this together, we might as well know each other better.  I will start.~ [O#NEL041]
@1    = ~I am called Nella.  I was born in Bryn Shander some twenty years ago.  When I was fifteen, I felt the call of the Tree.  I headed to Kuldahar, and there my real life started.~
@2    = ~Together with the druids of Kuldahar, we work on protecting and nourishing these lands.  My travels led me here, and now I am ready to return home.~
@3    = ~I am Korin, though my name will tell you nothing.  For several years now, I have been a ranger in these parts.~
@4    = ~The rumors of strange goings-on reached my ears, and I want to repay these people for their hospitality.  Hrothgar told me he was gathering adventurers for some important and dangerous venture, so I am here.~
@5    = ~Ha!  *My* story would fill a thousand pages, but I will give you a short version.~
@6    = ~I am Teri, a swashbuckler and a rogue.  Back in Amn, not a single temple, palace or guildhall was safe from my daring attacks.  Every treasury was mine.  For several happy years, I evaded capture...  and then his people caught me.~
@7    = ~We are trembling in anticipation, lady.  Who was the lucky hunter?~
@8    = ~The prince.  One of the merchant princes of Amn.  He would have let me hang, but my unearthly beauty seemed to soothe and mollify him, so instead of sending me to the gallows, he quietly put me on a ship heading for Icewind Dale.  Now that I am here, I might as well follow you.   Glory and gold, as they say.   End of story.~
@9    = ~And a fascinating story it is.  I am sure you are not exaggerating, not even a little bit.~
@10   = ~I should think so!  What of you, boy with a flute?~
@11   = ~Oh, my story is frankly boring.  I was born, and at some point I decided I was born a bard.  Nobody tried to convince me to the contrary, so I became a wandering minstrel.~
@12   = ~I wandered, wandered, and ended up here.  Not the most interesting of biographies, but there you go.~
@13   = ~Hrothgar is waiting for us, but I cannot leave the table without introducing myself.  I am Holvir, a paladin of Tyr.~
@14   = ~Hrothgar summoned me here, and I must say, it is an honor to be working for peace and goodwill of all the good folk among such distinguished companions.  My skills will be of use, I hope.~
@15   = ~I am <CHARNAME>.  I came to Easthaven to seek adventure.~
@16   = ~Suffice it to say that my name is <CHARNAME>.  I am sure we will know more about each other as our journey progresses.~
@17   = ~<CHARNAME>, an adventurer.  And now that we know each other a little better, let us go.~
@18   = ~Let us go, then.~
@19   = ~Time waits for no man! I am sure Hrothgar has something important to tell us.~
@20   = ~What a day!  Hey, who will play snowballs with me?~ [O#TER041]
@21   = ~Teri, we haven't really the time...~
@22   = ~Come!  It's not as if we're going to enjoy our freedom for a long time, eh?  Hey, Severn, take that!~
@23   = ~Ow!  Not in the face!  Anyway, why so excited?  One could think you haven't seen snow before.~ [O#SEV041]
@24   = ~Ha!  No, I haven't seen snow before.  So shiny!  And it's not cold at all - must be my elven side - ow!~
@25   = ~Right in the shoulder, now, that hurt!  Where did this snowball come from?~
@26   = ~ ... it was you, wasn't it, bard?  You've been trying to distract me all along, you!~
@27   = ~Even the mightiest of rogues can be distracted.  Take that!~
@28   = ~You... you... ah, have at thee!  Hahaha!  Everyone, join in!~
@29   = ~Teri, now is not really the time.~
@30   = ~No, thank you.~
@31   = ~With pleasure!~
@32   = ~You thought that snowball came from Severn, did you?  Well, here's another one!~
@33   = ~Then, bard, it's your turn!  Defend yourself!~
@34   = ~Haha!  Here we go!~
@35   = ~Aaargh!  You rogue!~
@36   = ~Looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.~
@37   = ~I come here every time I visit Easthaven.~ [O#NEL042]
@38   = ~It is so quiet here.  Do you worship Tempus, then?~ [O#KOR041]
@39   = ~I am a servant of the Great Oak, as I told you all.  I come here to remember.~
@40   = ~Are you speaking of Jerrod's sacrifice?~
@41   = ~One of the greatest deeds in history.  I heard many tales in Kuldahar.  Not just Jerrod's, but others, great and majestic.  And these legends only grew taller, to the point where I could no longer believe these things took place here, in these lands.~
@42   = ~When doubt overcomes me, I come here.  I see the stone, and the tale forges itself anew in front of my eyes.  And I believe.~
@43   = ~What about you, Korin?  You saw Jerrod's Stone, you know his tale.  Do you believe?~ [O#NEL043]
@44   = ~I do not have to believe.  I remember.  Jerrod... this was before my time.  But there were other battles, those I witnessed; other tales.~ [O#KOR042]
@45   = ~Perhaps some day our own epic will be told by the firesides all over Faerun.  Do you want that?~
@46   = ~I want to be remembered.  But if I am, my story will spread far and wide; it will belong to everyone.  My life will no longer remain my own.  Do I want that?  Do you?~
@47   = ~Think of Jerrod.  His legend was taller than life, but it was his life that became a legend.~
@48   = ~He lived it, but it belonged to his people, his god from the very start.  As does his sacrifice.~
@49   = ~But it was his, nevertheless.~
@50   = ~He died before his legend grew tall.  No, this is different.~
@51   = ~Time will tell which of us knows the truth.~
@52   = ~But when one of us is proved right, will we have enough courage to tell each other?~
@53   = ~I live so close to these streets, but now they seem unfamiliar.~ [O#KOR043]
@54   = ~Oh, not this place again.  I spent half a tenday here, waiting for Hrothgar's word, and these were not enjoyable days.~ [O#NEL044]
@55   = ~Why?  Lazy days in the snow and the sun, or in a warm room near the fire...  You do not like simple comforts?~ [O#SEV042]
@56   = ~I do not like idleness.  Kuldahar is my favorite place in the world, but even there I spend only a day or two between tasks, though I miss Arundel dearly.  I mustn't.  Not while there is a job to do.~
@57   = ~And you make a beautiful valkyrie.  But there is pleasure of sorts in lazying about, in drawing every breath slowly... in living your life at your own pace.~
@58   = ~But I do live it at my own pace, Severn.  Or are you trying to slow me down?~
@59   = ~Gods forbid!  You shall run me through and never notice!~
@60   = ~Nonsense.~
@61   = ~So you say.~
@62   = ~Our first mission is complete.  My friends, this is a big accomplishment.~ [O#HOL041]
@63   = ~A truly glorious feat indeed.  I am sure goblins think so.~ [O#TER042]
@64   = ~Greater dangers and far more impressive enemies are doubtlessly awaiting us ahead, but we have made a good start.~
@65   = ~Holvir, you sound like a prig.  Not a really pompous one, but still.  Why?  I mean, why do you need to say that?~
@66   = ~How often do you hear "That was masterfully done!", Teri?~
@67   = ~Not often, but I do not need to... all right, it was pleasant.  In a way.  But it doesn't give you the right to say the words every bloody time!~
@68   = ~I promise not to do it very often.  Especially when you are around.~
@69   = ~Did... did you just wink at me?~
@70   = ~Holvir, you are limping.~ [O#SEV043]
@71   = ~It is only a scratch.  I will tend to it when we are in Kuldahar.~ [O#HOL042]
@72   = ~Did you twist it when... when the avalanche... ?~
@73   = ~Yes.  I ran forward, the crust gave way, and I fell rather awkwardly.  Then I looked back, and suddenly the pain did not matter any more.~
@74   = ~But you, Severn - I do not see your flute with you.~
@75   = ~The avalanche crippled me, too, in a way.  But I will sing a cappella!~
@76   = ~Shout again, and we will have another avalanche.  And we - ow! - cannot run fast enough.~
@77   = ~Some scratches run deep.~
@78   = ~So they do.~
@79   = ~Hrothgar was a good man.  I hope his last decision was also a good one.~ [O#HOL043]
@80   = ~You know, compared to this avalanche, that rotten performance back in Baldur's Gate sounds insignificant.~ [O#SEV044]
@81   = ~I should think so!  Hrothgar is dead, and so many others, too!~
@82   = ~I can feel a story coming on.~
@83   = ~A rotten performance?  Do tell!~
@84   = ~So this is the Great Oak.  And your brethren care about it, Nella?  It's so great and so... fragile, somehow.  It scares me.  What will happen to it when you are all gone?~ [O#TER043]
@85   = ~Other druids will come to Kuldahar.  We will not leave the Tree to the winds.~ [O#NEL045]
@86   = ~I needed to hear that.  It's so beautiful here, so peaceful.  Why do we have to leave?~
@87   = ~We do not have to leave yet, and we will come back.  I understand your awe, Teri.  When I first saw the Tree with my parents, I was eleven.  We were travelling with a caravan, and it was leaving on the morn.  I begged and begged my parents to let me stay.~
@88   = ~What happened?~
@89   = ~They did not let me, so I escaped in the night and hid in the branches.  But Arundel found me.  He felt the call of the Tree, came, and the Tree just let me go, so I slid all the way down to his feet.~
@90   = ~We spent the night talking.  In the morning, I stood up and went to my parents, but I vowed I would come back.  And four years later, I did.  Do you feel the same, Teri?~
@91   = ~Er... no.  But I would like to come back.~
@92   = ~I see a wizard's tower here.  Something I will never have.~ [O#KOR044]
@93   = ~A fine display of swords.  The work of a true craftsman.~ [O#HOL044]
@94   = ~I often come here.  Watching the blades being made... it is just like magic.~ [O#NEL046]
@95   = ~Magic?  I forged my sword myself, when I was still a squire.  I was proud of it, but I can hardly call the process magical.~
@96   = ~But it is, and it makes you a magician, see?  This world is full of miracles.  Look at the Tree, giving warmth among snows and icy peaks.  Look at these lumps of coal and bars of steel - in days, they will become hammers and swords.~
@97   = ~The flowers bloom throughout each spring and summer.  The sun comes up every morning.  The pie in your backpack used to grow in a field.  It is magic.~
@98   = ~I see.  You are a romantic, Nella.~
@99   = ~So are you.  We believe in the same thing: we are both fighting to see these miracles continue.~
@100  = ~"House of the Bleeding Rose", it was written over the threshold.  What an image these words create!~ [O#KOR045]
@101  = ~Hah, yes.  My parents pay their respects to Hanali, the Golden Rose, and roses seem to follow me wherever I go.  What do the priests mean when they speak of roses, do you think?~ [O#TER044]
@102  = ~Perhaps our thoughts?  The image occupies them, after all.  Or something precious to us: perhaps your parents thought of you.~
@103  = ~Perhaps they did.  I'll be sure to ask.  I haven't seen them in months, though; I miss them.~
@104  = ~Where are they now?~
@105  = ~Travelling with the pirates of the Inner Sea; they are adventurers, like me.  I know, it sounds incredibly romantic, but not to me: I get seasick as soon as I get on board.  I may keep walking for hours and hours and never get tired, but the sea... ugh.  The journey to the Dale nearly killed me.~
@106  = ~They start each day thanking the goddess of love for bringing them together and watching over them.  I know they must be alive.  Mmm... Korin?~
@107  = ~Yes?~
@108  = ~If I send a prayer to the Bleeding Rose, will the Golden Rose hear it, do you think?  These damned flowers have to communicate somehow.~
@109  = ~I would not use such strong language, but I suppose there is a chance, yes.~
@110  = ~Worth a try, then.  Thank you.~
@111  = ~... but Hanali's ways are too golden for me.  I have Tymora to thank for keeping me alive.~ [O#TER045]
@112  = ~Curious you would speak so much of Hanali, though...  The goddess plays an important part in my life.~ [O#KOR046]
@113  = ~You, Korin, and a goddess of love?~
@114  = ~It is certainly nothing as direct as that.  Hanali is not just any goddess: she is love, the greatest mystery of all.~
@115  = ~Though there was a more... physical aspect to my worship, I suppose, but...~
@116  = ~Do tell, do tell!~
@117  = ~I have unleashed a demon of curiosity, it seems.  It is not much of a tale, Teri.  Perhaps another time.~
@118  = ~Finally, warmth and light!  A keg of ale is all I need.~ [O#SEV045]
@119  = ~And this is all?  There is nothing else you desire?  Not even female company?~ [O#TER046]
@120  = ~Well... not that I'd mind, but while farmers and fishermen are cordiality itself when you're buying something, approach their daughters, and they freeze solid.~
@121  = ~Once, I was nearly chased out of the city.  A shame, really.  And it's not like I even tried to *seduce* anyone!  A kiss in the stable yard was all it took.~
@122  = ~Well, you have your whole life ahead of you.~
@123  = ~I'll, er, keep it in mind.~
@124  = ~Another dead bird.  This place is foul.~ [O#SEV046]
@125  = ~And freezing.  I should have gone into hiding somewhere warm.  Calimshan, jewels, men kissing my feet... or lying at my feet with their throats cut... hot wine, laughter, birds singing...~ [O#TER047]
@126  = ~Think of the bright side: because of our actions, the birds will sing again.~
@127  = ~Yes, but can you take a birdsong home and make a diadem out of it?~
@128  = ~I could say something in the same vein.  But turning the Vale of Shadows into the Vale of Song is a worthy endeavor, even if both of us are more than a little cynical about it.~
@129  = ~They will fly, yet.  And you will sit in Calimshite silks, watch powerful and wealthy men prostrate themselves before you, listen to the birdsong, and smile.~
@130  = ~Hmm.  You know, you'll make a good fortune teller one day.~
@131  = ~Holvir, I have a question for you that you'd best not to share with anyone.~ [O#NEL047]
@132  = ~Of course, Nella.  I shall do my best to answer.~ [O#HOL045]
@133  = ~I haven't spent much time in crypts and caves.  And with blindingly white snow outside, my eyes cannot see here, it's pitch dark!  I hear sounds and breaths and voices, but for the first few seconds, I am nearly blind.~
@134  = ~I do not want to put my comrades' lives at risk.  What do I do?~
@135  = ~On the threshold of light and dark, close your eyes and count to ten.  Slowly.  I will watch your back.~
@136  = ~I will do it, but... close my eyes?  And this is it?~
@137  = ~It helps me.~
@138  = ~But who watches your back, Holvir?~
@139  = ~You.  Our leader.  We are in this together.  Come, you'll feel better once outside.~
@140  = ~Holvir, what is arrogance?  As a paladin, you are best suited to know.~ [O#KOR047]
@141  = ~I would not say you are an arrogant man.~ [O#HOL046]
@142  = ~And I believe I am.  What is it?  Superior manner?  Pride?  Being secure in the knowledge that your race is better?  Being always right?~
@143  = ~There were times when I thought I possessed it all in abundance.  Now I do so no longer, but my base nature remains the same, and I was arrogant, I recall it so well.  I must be, still.~
@144  = ~You are searching for an answer within yourself, Korin.  You will not accept it from anyone else.~
@145  = ~True enough.  But you did not even try to give it to me.  You do not ask us about anything, either.~
@146  = ~Yet I seek to prove my worth with you and the others.  Perhaps in the end, we are searching for an answer to the same question.~
@147  = ~We are mere miles from Kuldahar, but already the cold is pressing.  It's worse than it was in Easthaven, too.  As if some malevolent power wanted to envelop us in its frozen breath.~ [O#NEL048]
@148  = ~Finally!  I shall be glad to leave.~ [O#SEV047]
@149  = ~Elves have no place underground.  If there is one thing I hate, it is the rattling of rotting bones.~ [O#KOR048]
@150  = ~Urgh... I feel sick.  Gods, I am no adventurer.  I am a weak excuse for a bard...~
@151  = ~Who covered my back at least twice in these passages.~
@152  = ~It wasn't like I had a choice.  I wanted to become a part of a story, but looks like I am destined for an epitaph, and a short one, at that.~
@153  = ~*sigh* I am useless.~
@154  = ~I will not lie, I thought so, too.  But then you sang.  It felt like going home and going off to die at the same time.  It felt like the victory was ours, and shall be, forever.  It felt like brotherhood in arms.~
@155  = ~This is your calling, Severn.  Never doubt that.~
@156  = ~Sweet words, but the prospect of delighting the audience of these hallowed halls seems quite bleak.~
@157  = ~What about us?  Besides, it's glory or death now.  There is no turning back.~
@158  = ~I have not been underground for so long that I had forgotten what it feels like.~ [O#KOR049]
@159  = ~Ah-ha, that's more like it!  Traps and danger afoot, and the inviting gleam of treasure to boot!~ [O#TER048]
@160  = ~Such splendor...~ [O#TER049]
@161  = ~And all for skeletons.~ [O#SEV048]
@162  = ~Pfft!  All for us!  Honestly, I do not understand why people won't simply-~
@163  = ~Bring a few priests here, fill every crevice with holy water, collect and purify the treasures, and open a temple or a monastery?~
@164  = ~Well, yes!~
@165  = ~And when children start to disappear, priests begin having dark visions and panic seizes these halls, whom will you blame?  The ancients knew their craft.  This place is a tomb.  Forever is.~
@166  = ~Let us find the owner, then.  I want to say a few words to him... and seriously worsen his living conditions.~
@167  = ~Undead everywhere.  It is worse than I thought.~ [O#HOL047]
@168  = ~Why?  These are just a few zombies and skeletons.~
@169  = ~Do you sense something?~
@170  = ~Indeed.~
@171  = ~I have no time for idle chatter.~
@172  = ~So this... Black Wolf is not just an undead - he is an immortal.~ [O#TER050]
@173  = ~A prisoner.~ [O#NEL049]
@174  = ~This place is like a palace to him, I guess.  Servants at his beck and call, too.  Well, not any more, but you know what I mean.~
@175  = ~Would you like to live such a life, Teri?~
@176  = ~Not chained to one particular place.  *That'd* be boring.  But I'd be invincible!  I could go anywhere I liked, learn all the secrets of the world, laugh, embrace the skies!  Touch?  It's overrated!~
@177  = ~And one day, a powerful enough priest will put you to your final rest, as he should.~
@178  = ~That's the downside.~
@179  = ~Severn, what do you need this branch for?~ [O#KOR050]
@180  = ~I will carve myself a new flute.~ [O#SEV049]
@181  = ~It may be a little cold for playing.~
@182  = ~Oh, it never is.  Besides, you should hear me sing when my throat is sore!  In those happy hours, all maidens are mine.~
@183  = ~You do not look a womanizer.  Or has someone told you that every bard should be one?~
@184  = ~Every bard should *strive* to be one.  Then, when I feel I am confident enough to woo any maiden without shame, I will be able to forget about this side of life entirely, should I wish to.  But for now, I must practise.~
@185  = ~Well.  Good luck in this noble endeavor.~
@186  = ~The trees breathe easier.  A cloud has lifted.~ [O#NEL050]
@187  = ~Ah, Kuldahar.  You started smiling long before we breathed the scent of the cooking fires, Nella.~ [O#HOL048]
@188  = ~Home always beckons.  And I am hungry.~ [O#NEL051]
@189  = ~This perhaps can be mended.  I will never rival your herblore, but I am good with spices.  Would you say yes to a roast chicken with rice?~
@190  = ~It sets my mouth to water.  I did not know you can cook, Holvir.~
@191  = ~Just like any other squire, I had to learn many skills in the Order.  Should your cloak or armor need mending, you have but to ask.~
@192  = ~Paladins, it seems, are full of surprises.~
@193  = ~So, correct me if I am wrong, but he knew the gem would be here, and has known for ages.  For several years, at least.  So why didn't he check for it himself?~ [O#TER051]
@194  = ~He is a powerful man, but not omniscient.  There is not much he could do, even with the help of his devoted students.  No, the task falls to us, and we shall fulfill it the best we can.~ [O#HOL049]
@195  = ~Nooo, not your pompous speeches again.  Honestly, don't you ever get tired of them?~
@196  = ~Do you ever get tired of your jokes?~
@197  = ~Not with you listening.~
@198  = ~So, "bad priests", as our friend outside said, eh?  This doesn't sound so good.~ [O#TER052]
@199  = ~Can you hear them?  There's more.  Did I mention that I do not like this?~ [O#SEV050]
@200  = ~More than once.~ [O#NEL052]
@201  = ~I'm not a warrior.  Look at you: cool, collected, concentrated, just like a real hero should be.  I wish I had your composure.~
@202  = ~Severn, I may seem calm, but this is not true.  I am trembling inside, too.~
@203  = ~But you do not fear monsters, do you?  You fear that *you* may not be good enough, but your heart knows what you must do.~
@204  = ~You are astute for a bard.~
@205  = ~I try.~
@206  = ~So the Heartstone Gem had been lying here for several years, and then, several hours ago, someone came and stole it.  Such a coincidence, eh?~ [O#SEV051]
@207  = ~Corpses all around, and we are leaving empty-handed.  Won-der-ful.~ [O#TER053]
@208  = ~And now you are looking for a likely victim to storm at, aren't you?~ [O#KOR051]
@209  = ~Er... yes.  How did you know?~
@210  = ~It's plainly written on your face for all to see, just as the glint in your eye when you look at our backpacks.~
@211  = ~Quite a haul, isn't it?  Heheh.  But I want to be able to say we've *done* something, and we haven't.~
@212  = ~I suppose you won't take "but now we know that the Heartstone Gem is not here" for an answer?~
@213  = ~Not a chance.~
@214  = ~Well, then "we are finally leaving" will have to do.  I may even throw in "dinner later", for it befits my people to be generous.~
@215  = ~Pfft!  I like the word "dinner", but not so much when it is followed by "a long march".  Ah well.  We are alive, there are stars outside, and that's what counts.  That, and the loot, obviously.~
@216  = ~When you mentioned stars, my breathing nearly stopped.  Did my ears deceive me?  But the loot - oh, yes.  This is the Teri we know.~
@217  = ~We are walking in circles.  Someone is one step in front of us.  Who?~ [O#HOL050]
@218  = ~It's so warm in here.~ [O#HOL051]
@219  = ~A welcome break, isn't it?  I can feel my toes again.~ [O#SEV052]
@220  = ~I prefer the cold climes, myself.~
@221  = ~You must have one good reason.  For me, winter has always been a challenge: wolves, the cold, storing food...  Our farmstead stood several miles away from the village, so I could not visit often, not in winter.~
@222  = ~But when I did, oh, these were the days.  Adventurers and bards, stranded in the tavern, singing songs, exchanging tales - it was an entirely different world.  I knew I'd want to become a part of it some day.~
@223  = ~You were lucky.~
@224  = ~Was I?  Quiet, patriarchal life on a farm with three older brothers; hard work from dawn to dusk and practically nothing else to do?  Indeed, can you get any luckier?~
@225  = ~Even an old, sickly beggar is lucky in his own kind of way.  But I was speaking of another gift; of innocence.~
@226  = ~Erevain?  Here?  How can it be?~ [O#KOR052]
@227  = ~This place, these people... prisoners, their clothes in tatters, the unbearable heat... it takes me back.~ [O#HOL052]
@228  = ~I miss the old, quiet days sometimes.  In these caves, don't you recall the nights spent under the Great Tree, Nella?~ [O#KOR053]
@229  = ~I do, and often.  But then I think of how we shall emerge triumphant, with the Heartstone Gem in our hands, and I smile when I think of Arundel's smile.~ [O#NEL053]
@230  = ~Does his opinion matter that much to you?~
@231  = ~I look into his eyes and I see love.  And I know that every village kid can say the same.  He is very kind, and it is not some impersonal kindness - he wants to do good, and does.  He is wise, but so unobtrusive.  I...~
@232  = ~You love him.~
@233  = ~I love him.  I love him like the rain and the sun, the best teacher and the family I always wanted to have.~
@234  = ~It is... hard, sometimes, to think I shall never see my family again.  Though perhaps I shall scrape up the courage.  Treasure yours.~
@235  = ~Urgh, I think the poison seeped into my clothes.  Talonites, pah!  I'd like to send them the cleaning bills.~ [O#SEV053]
@236  = ~I say, how about a song?  I know a beautiful Cormyrean tune.~ [O#SEV054]
@237  = ~I would welcome it, if not for the echo in these caves.  It will attract the remaining Talonites in no time.~ [O#HOL053]
@238  = ~True enough.  Hmm, what about a nefarious ambush, then?  I will sing, you will ambush, then we split the loot.  By the way, how come you are allowed to loot in the first place?  I wish to make a complaint.~
@239  = ~Well, the nearest Tyr's temple is located in -~
@240  = ~A-ha!  Blasphemy, as well.  Pray, continue...~
@241  = ~Severn, I respect the fallen.  Don't you have better things to do than tease me about my duties?~
@242  = ~Severn, I respect the fallen.  Erevain's sword, for one, will be returned to his family.  Don't you have better things to do than tease me about my duties?~
@243  = ~Like a song, perhaps?  I know a beautiful Cormyrean tune.~
@244  = ~Of course, why...?  Wait.  You have been planning to distract me all along!~
@245  = ~Alas!  A minstrel has to sing, my good paladin.~
@246  = ~What a prude!  Waited to be taken by Talonites, bah!  What about tending to the ill and wounded in Kuldahar, hmm?  Were they too far beneath her notice?~ [O#TER054]
@247  = ~She offered us healing, Teri.~ [O#HOL054]
@248  = ~Yes, at a "fair price", which is roughly translated as "sheer robbery".  What is she playing at?  We saved her life!~
@249  = ~There are others trapped in these caves, villagers and children and gods alone know who else.  She and the temple will use our money to buy more supplies...~
@250  = ~... In trapped Kuldahar that no merchant dares visit.  Excellent logic.~
@251  = ~What makes you think so?  There are always ways and paths.  Look at us: we made it to Dragon's Eye.~
@252  = ~I see that you are determined to protect Egenia at all costs.  Well, at least you are not calling her "Lady Egenia".~
@253  = ~If that is your will, Lady Teri.  I agree that her actions lacked logic at times, and her... pricing was unreasonable.  But she was not acting out of malice.  We may not always understand each other, but we are fighting for the same cause.~
@254  = ~If you say so.  As long as we are not destroyed by friendly fire.~
@255  = ~You look more confident, Severn.~ [O#NEL054]
@256  = ~I feel important.  When a powerful necromancer employs a seven-foot skeleton just to announce how dead he is going to make you, it boosts one's ego considerably.~ [O#SEV055]
@257  = ~I was not trained in combat, but I am learning.  You, too, seem more imposing.~
@258  = ~Was that a compliment or a warning?~
@259  = ~What do you think?~
@260  = ~I feel I am bordering on arrogant, sometimes, and it worries me.  Arundel said something about destinies: they shine all the brighter when one moves forward, but when one sits and reflects on his self-importance, their light becomes dim.~
@261  = ~Cryptic as always, but he had a point.  I wouldn't worry about it too much, though.  In the end, it may turn out your destiny is to save me from a six-armed gargoyle right around the corner.~
@262  = ~My, such a stinging blow to my pride!  Thank you, Severn.~
@263  = ~Always a pleasure.  But just the same, keep an eye out for that gargoyle.~
@264  = ~I swear, if I hear this sack of bones again, somebody's going to receive a huge kick.~ [O#TER055]
@265  = ~You told me earlier that you used to be a mage, Korin.~ [O#HOL055]
@266  = ~Your resident arrogant wizard, at your service.  That is, until the power had gone out of me.~ [O#KOR054]
@267  = ~And then you told me it used to be your best guarded secret, at least until recently.  Why have you decided to reveal it?~
@268  = ~Not why, I think.  Rather, what for.~
@269  = ~I want to see the real me.  Not that young mage, for he is dead.  Not a hermit ranger, for he is a part of me, but only a part.~
@270  = ~And to become myself, I have to see myself through the eyes of others.  I have to tell the truth, otherwise why try?~
@271  = ~I understand.  Now that I know what you want, I will help you the best I can.~
@272  = ~Thank you.  Earlier we spoke of arrogance; perhaps friendship is a cure?  Come, we can talk of it as we walk.~
@273  = ~Civilization, here?  What is it, a temple?~ [O#TER056]
@274  = ~Or another tomb.  Step carefully.~ [O#NEL055]
@275  = ~Mosaic, furniture, doors!  Somebody lives here, look!~
@276  = ~Teri, you are hopeless.  Stop!  What if the floor is trapped?~
@277  = ~I che-~
@278  = ~Ahem.  On the other hand, you just may be right.  Step aside, please.  Oh, and feel free to brandish your big stick, in case something attacks.~
@279  = ~Do I sense envy?~
@280  = ~My hands... I am becoming weaker.~ [O#NEL056]
@281  = ~Nella, what is wrong?~ [O#HOL056]
@282  = ~I do not know.  I feel as though my head is about to melt.  There is something powerful here, and it does not want us to proceed.~
@283  = ~Yes, you should be sensitive to it.  But why do I feel nothing?~
@284  = ~It is not undead or unnatural.  But it singled me out for some reason, and it... hurts.  No, do not offer your arm.  I shall pull myself together... in a moment.~
@285  = ~I think I know the reason.  Arundel is your mentor, and it senses your connection.  It knows that the Heartstone Gem belonged to the druids, and that they are coming to return it.~
@286  = ~And so we shall.  Come, I shall be here to catch you, if you stumble.~
@287  = ~So will I.  Our enemies will not see us falling apart.~
@288  = ~Falling is a luxury I cannot afford.  But stay close, if you will - and thank you.~
@289  = ~There are good adventurers and bad adventurers.  Naturally, we are the good ones.  But there is a more fickle division between elite adventurers and plain travellers.~ [O#SEV056]
@290  = ~Do you mean the social standing or something else?~
@291  = ~The former, since it implies so much.  Education, manners, and, why, equipment, as well.~
@292  = ~Ah, of course.  But the Order of the Knights of Holy Judgement provides fairly for all, and, truly, other squires were a fine body of young men.  As for me, I was never ashamed to say I am common by birth, and as for my companions, I could not wish a better fate for myself.~
@293  = ~I have not noticed, but I had no one to compare with.  Now I have you, but I do not feel especially maligned or revered.  As for my ancestry - an adventuress from a line of adventurers, a daughter of a rogue, what else could I have become?~
@294  = ~I am not nobility, but my skill was respected, as was my mother's.  Oh, her story!  She had conquered the Academy with her skill, declined all lucrative offers of office or marriage, and eventually gave her hand to her own aide.  They were never rich or royal, but I do not consider myself beneath anyone.~
@295  = ~Noble birth and money matter, and I should know.  My parents were traders, and their caravans often got a cool reception.  They never had to grovel - no!  But these were painful moments.  I would love to forget at least half of them.~
@296  = ~I suffered... ah, it came out wrong, didn't it?  I meant to say, yes, if I was a Grand Duke, or at least owned half of the city, I could have avoided some of the rough patches.  But as it is, it's not bad, too.~
@297  = ~And cheers to that!~
@298  = ~What about you, <CHARNAME>?  Do you think that ancestry matters among adventurers?  That it separates the men from... well, the other men?~
@299  = ~Of course it matters!  Noblemen and commoners, rich and poor - the difference is obvious!~
@300  = ~It does, but who you are is not set in stone.  A commoner can become a distinguished adventurer, and as for becoming rich, you have seen the contents of these chests.~
@301  = ~It is important to remember who you are.  But whoever thinks that a noble birth or a full pouch makes him a better person needs to have his head examined.~
@302  = ~No, it doesn't.  All adventurers are equal, and it is wonderful.~
@303  = ~It matters, but it does not especially worry me.~
@304  = ~I really cannot say.~
@305  = ~Hmm.  I wonder, would you regard me differently, had I said I was a prince of Athalantar, and my father was the richest man in the Realms, who disowned his wayward son... oh, I've lost myself here.  Never mind.~
@306  = ~That's inspiring.  A distinguished adventurer.  I like the sound of that.~
@307  = ~A wise saying is always at home anywhere.  Except that it is totally useless, but who cares about the details?~
@308  = ~You are an idealist, and this is wonderful.~
@309  = ~And you know, I think I am, too.~
@310  = ~And me.  I vaguely remember it should be important, but here and now, I am among friends, and I don't care.~
@311  = ~Well, as far as I know, I am not of noble birth, but from the way things are going, we shall become filthy rich fairly soon.  I shall take heart in that.~
@312  = ~I will never understand betrayal.  It tarnishes the soul, fills the traitor with guilt and shame.  Who would undertake it willingly?~ [O#HOL057]
@313  = ~I am growing tired.  How many more snakepeople are here?~ [O#KOR055]
@314  = ~Half a dozen at least.  Has it occurred to you that we may die, Korin?~ [O#SEV057]
@315  = ~Here and in a great many other places.  Why do you ask?~
@316  = ~I have been thinking of home.  A sunny morning in the kitchen, and boiling potatoes.  And then I realized I may never taste them again.  Never.~
@317  = ~I hate to interrupt your emotional moment, but...  Weeping for a lost homeland, for a dear friend - this I can understand.  But... potatoes?~
@318  = ~You are pulling my leg, aren't you?~
@319  = ~Me?  Pulling your leg?  A haughty, serene, mysterious elven ranger?~
@320  = ~Severn, if you think it is funny, I shall be happy to educate you: it is not.~
@321  = ~No, I'm not, really.  Seriously, I miss that sunny kitchen.  I even miss the burnt and crunchy bits, though this must sound entirely silly.  I just wanted to ask: in moments like these, caught between the rock and the hard place, do you feel the same towards anything?  Don't answer if you don't want to.~
@322  = ~Icicles.  Icicles on the roof, and water, dripping off them on sunny mornings and waking me up.~
@323  = ~And on the cloudy days?  Sorry, I just had to ask.~
@324  = ~I opened my eyes to the smell of coming rain.  Or the taste of the snowfall.  No, now I am pulling your leg: I woke up when I did.  But thank you for taking me seriously.~
@325  = ~<CHARNAME>, before we proceed, I want to ask you something.~ [O#TER057]
@326  = ~Something profoundly troubling is afoot.~ [O#KOR056]
@327  = ~What, besides cryptic warnings and assassination attempts?~ [O#TER058]
@328  = ~Yes.  I do not understand these Yuan-ti's connection to our enemy.   The one who is planning to destroy Kuldahar.~
@329  = ~They look as though they've long lived here, but our visit has been expected.  And, of course, they must have acquired the Heartstone Gem scant days ago.~
@330  = ~And your point is?~
@331  = ~They are either in league with our enemy, and have stolen the artifact for him, or they are enemies and rivals, and the theft has been done to spite whoever is behind the recent goings-on in Kuldahar.~
@332  = ~In both cases, Kuldahar remains helpless.  Bah!  What are we even doing here?~
@333  = ~Searching for the Heartstone Gem and the answers.  We will find them - we have to.~
@334  = ~Uh-huh.  As long as these answers do not find us first.~
@335  = ~Teri?  Are you all right?  That Yuan-ti torturer...~ [O#SEV058]
@336  = ~Well, I am not on his rack, so I'm fine.  I... ugh...  Oh.~ [O#TER059]
@337  = ~You do look a little bit pale.  I'd offer for you to lie down, but as the only available surface here is covered with blood, I suppose it won't work.~
@338  = ~Touched by your concern, truly.  Especially now, after all these days.  Severn, you've been avoiding me.~
@339  = ~Have I?~
@340  = ~Yes.  You haven't spoken to me since... let's see.  Kresselack's tomb?~
@341  = ~Teri, I... mmm.  I just feel... tongue-tied?~
@342  = ~Hmph!  We will talk again, mind you.  I do not like this.~
@343  = ~This chainmail...  look at this!~ [O#KOR057]
@344  = ~At last!  I was afraid we'd never find it.~ [O#NEL057]
@345  = ~You were rather nervous, I can say as much.~
@346  = ~So was I.  Hmm, sparkly!~
@347  = ~Arundel will be pleased.  I know he has faith in you.~
@348  = ~Now everyone will breathe easier.  A song, perhaps?~
@349  = ~I kept biting my lips as we walked.  I am still anxious; we should get back as soon as possible.~
@350  = ~You look so peaceful and relaxed, Nella.  Obviously, we should find these Heartstone Gems more often.  It's good for your looks.~ [O#SEV059]
@351  = ~Thank you, Severn.  Oh, I am very happy.  Just wait until Arundel sees it!~ [O#NEL058]
@352  = ~We are alive, victorious, and love is in the air!  What else to wish for?~
@353  = ~Hmm, love is in the air?  We should be careful, I see.~
@354  = ~Er, yes, but I did not say the name.  So, please, do not treat it like a confession.~
@355  = ~It is so natural, isn't it?  Here we are, fighting and exploring together, young, full of enthusiasm and energy - of course some of us will fall in love.  I... do not think I am in love, yet, though.~
@356  = ~My fair lady Nella, worry not: I understand you are trying to spare my feelings.  My heart, however, lies elsewhere.  I am not quite sure myself where it lies, in fact, as I seem to have misplaced it... or has someone stolen it?~
@357  = ~Careful, Severn.  Sune has a cruel streak.~
@358  = ~*sigh* And so does the lady.~
@359  = ~Now we are real adventurers!  Tired and battered, coming to the surface after a long, long time underground, with a marvellous haul and the mysterious Heartstone Gem to boot!~ [O#TER060]
@360  = ~Holvir, you are supposed to say something about our achievements now.~ [O#TER061]
@361  = ~You are doing quite well on your own, Teri.  I would rather you had the pleasure.~ [O#HOL058]
@362  = ~Well!  And you have nothing to add?~
@363  = ~Not especially.  Except that I noticed a certain young lady taking peeks at the Heartstone Gem now and then, each time withdrawing with a highly disappointed look.~
@364  = ~I am not going to disappear with it!  I would just... just like to know.  Certain things.~
@365  = ~Wouldn't you like to know your future?  Who you will love and who will love you, whether you live or die, become the greatest hero to walk the Realms, or only the second greatest one?  I am dying to find out, and now we can!~
@366  = ~Only if Arundel lets us, and I will refuse even if he does.~
@367  = ~Even if... but why?~
@368  = ~Because your future is your own.  There is always a choice.~
@369  = ~Orogs in Kuldahar?  Tyr's mercy, what is happening here?~ [O#HOL059]
@370  = ~While we were underground, these monsters ravaged Kuldahar...~ [O#KOR058]
@371  = ~We must see Arundel.  At once!~
@372  = ~No, we must help these people first, here and now.  I am staying.~
@373  = ~We will be able to do nothing if these monsters keep arriving!  We must find the source.~
@374  = ~Even if this man dies? ... No, you are right.  We must know the answers, now!  Lead on.~
@375  = ~Holvir is right.  First and foremost, we must find out what is going on.~
@376  = ~I agree with Korin.  We must help these people.~
@377  = ~Let us go.~
@378  = ~Then let us do so.~
@379  = ~Lead on.~
@380  = ~Master... master...~ [O#NEL059]
@381  = ~So, we travel to the elven lands.  I am looking forward to this journey.~ [O#KOR059]
@382  = ~This was Larrel?  A mighty archmage, chasing squirrels?~ [O#HOL060]
@383  = ~Rubble, debris, neglect.  And... aaand... are these transparent goblins?  And orcs?  Are you sure this is not the time to get out?~ [O#SEV060]
@384  = ~No, I think this is the time for the big talk.  Of course, I could wait until we deal with the goblins, but our leader will always find some more.  So: why haven't we talked in days?~ [O#TER062]
@385  = ~Hmm.  I could ask you the same question.  Why haven't *you* approached me in days?~
@386  = ~I don't know.  I felt like I - as if I was afraid to approach you.  For some reason.  Wait, wait, why are you asking me?  I should be demanding an answer from *you*, so deliver it, bard!~
@387  = ~Stand and delivah, eh?  All right.  Teri, I am sorry, but it seems I am falling in love.~
@388  = ~Uh-huh.  And who is the lucky lady?~
@389  = ~I feel the symptoms.  This free and easy feeling I could approach you with and make you smile - it is gone.  I blush, stumble, and mope about in the most un-bardly fashion.~
@390  = ~Oh.  Um.  This, er, changes the situation.  Do you need help?  And right away: all this "Come to me, my deva!" business is out of the question.~
@391  = ~Eh, I suspected as much.  But - yes, I need help.  I need your friendship.  I want to be able to talk to you again, because from the very start, you were important to me.  You are.~
@392  = ~I... I'll help the best I can, then.  And enough of this.  Time to deal with these goblins - sing for me!~
@393  = ~Patience is the hardest of all virtues.  Especially now, as I walk deprived of my mentor, my friend, my home and my revenge.~ [O#NEL060]
@394  = ~You still have not said a word since we entered the tower.  Are you all right, Korin?~ [O#HOL061]
@395  = ~Not especially.  Would you be happy, walking among the ruins of your Order's headquarters?~ [O#KOR060]
@396  = ~I had.  The House of Persevering Order in Western Heartlands had nearly been destroyed by an angry mob; we defended the wounded inside, and I watched my friends falling beside me.  The Temple of Tyr was burnt... but Severed Hand was much more than that to your people, I know.~
@397  = ~This place is a song of the dead.  Every stone cries: "We lived!  We slept!  We fought!  We died!"  I see dried blood wherever I look.  Not going mad in here is already an achievement.~
@398  = ~The fruits of war are always bitter.  But Arundel would not have sent us without a purpose.  Something may yet be done.~
@399  = ~Like burning the place to the ground?  No, I am sorry.  You are right, and a part of me knows that keeping a cool head is the only way.  But how do you explain this to the screaming spirit?~
@400  = ~Faith and love are the best healers.~
@401  = ~They are too late here.~
@402  = ~Holvir, as a paladin... may I ask you something?  In private.  But don't laugh.~ [O#SEV061]
@403  = ~I promise you, I will take you seriously.~ [O#HOL062]
@404  = ~We are walking these halls, picking up pieces, and I am wondering if... if what we do is scavenging.  I look at these bodies, and I feel pangs of guilt.~
@405  = ~We are walking these halls, picking up pieces, and I am wondering if... if what we do is scavenging.  I look at these bodies, at Korin's face, and I feel pangs of guilt.~
@406  = ~I see.~
@407  = ~It did not matter among Myrkul's priesthood and Yuan-ti, but suddenly it does now.  And before... In difficult times, I often wanted to cut a pouch or two, but more often than not I went hungry.  Once I cut a pouch, snatched a couple of coins and called loudly to the owner, claiming he dropped it.  He called the guards.~
@408  = ~It was to be expected.~
@409  = ~I know, but what could I do?  Some idiot cut my arm, badly, and I spent half a tenday in bed, delirious.  I was too weak to perform, but I had to eat.  It was one of those incidents when everybody feels in the right and everybody feels slighted.  But you still have not answered my question.~
@410  = ~You said "if you say it is all right, it must be".  So you are not sure, and your inner voice is asking for confirmation?  Or an absolution?~
@411  = ~I do not know.  Even though I remember that these elves are long dead...  I do not know what it says.~
@412  = ~Listen to it.  It will reply better than I ever could.~
@413  = ~I think it burdens me, because we take these things and do not offer anything in return.  If we do - when we do - I shall be at rest.~
@414  = ~Then let us make it so.~
@415  = ~My head is spinning.  This elevator is, of course, an ingenious invention, but a little... unusual.~ [O#NEL061]
@416  = ~You've never seen anything of the kind before?  Because nearly every merchant house in Athkatla has one, and, of course, there are mages and their devices.~ [O#TER063]
@417  = ~I suspect you are exaggerating again, and these moving platforms are not as common as you are making them to be.  But I have not been outside of the Ten Towns and beyond the Spine of the World, so I would not know.~
@418  = ~*gasp* Ever?  Neither Neverwinter nor Waterdeep nor the Circle Sea?~
@419  = ~No.  But I have seen much of the Dale, and now this stronghold.  I count myself lucky.~
@420  = ~Weeell, you do, but what about those who will follow you?  Arundel must've seen a lot in his time.  If you want to end up in his place, to lead, you'll have to broaden your... oh.  Hells.  I am sorry.~
@421  = ~No matter: you cannot walk on tiptoe around me forever.  I may leave the Dale some day.  Without Arundel, even Kuldahar sounds cold... but not now.  Today, I want to protect Kuldahar and to avenge his death.  Nothing else.~
@422  = ~Wait, something feels wrong.  Where are the attacking hordes?  The undead?~ [O#TER064]
@423  = ~They are here.  Only... it is different.  I barely feel them in the Weave... their voices are weak and sad.  But there is no menace, no anger.~ [O#KOR061]
@424  = ~Sounds like we are about to hear a very sad tale.~
@425  = ~Or become a part of it.  They must be put to rest.~
@426  = ~The usual way?  Sword in the gullet?~
@427  = ~You know the answer.  Why did you have to say this?~
@428  = ~Because I like you, and you are slipping away.  Do not bury yourself in something that happened years and years ago, Korin.~
@429  = ~It is happening now, all around us.  If I close my mind, I will cease to be an elf.~
@430  = ~Sanity is not an option here, I see.  Well, I am part elf, too, and in the name of the Seldarine I command you: stop brooding!  We are all uneasy, but you - you look as if you are about to die!~
@431  = ~I will live.  Thank you, Teri.  I will not slip away, but I will continue to listen.~
@432  = ~Teri!  Look at this!~ [O#SEV062]
@433  = ~Looks like a seriously ravaged tower.  Larrel meant business.~ [O#TER065]
@434  = ~Forget ravaged, have you ever seen rocks floating in the air?~
@435  = ~Oh.  You don't say...  O-ho!  Severn, this is a perfect swing!  Come, help me up.~
@436  = ~Ahem.  You want to use one of these rocks as your rocking chair?~
@437  = ~A rocking rock for a rocking chair!  That's the word.  Hmm... this "we are the best of friends again" mantra is working, isn't it?~
@438  = ~Oh, yes.  It goes especially well with the scent of your hair.~
@439  = ~Ho-ho, compliments!  That was nice, but I wouldn't get your hopes up just yet.~
@440  = ~I promise not to push my luck.~
@441  = ~I am not cut out for this.  Give me an orc any day.  A mad priest?  No objection.  But these hapless souls...~ [O#SEV063]
@442  = ~Oswald would have loved this.  Back in Kuldahar, he always complained he needed more machinery for his flying ship.  And the elven craftsmen knew how to work with metal, judging by the looks of it.~ [O#NEL062]
@443  = ~I hope he will rebuild his ship nevertheless.  No doubt he will be missed in Kuldahar, when he does.~ [O#HOL063]
@444  = ~Funny how I never saw his ship fly or move, but Oswald has always been there, always repairing something, always promising it will fly tomorrow.  Yes, I will miss him.  I already do.~
@445  = ~You have never been this far from Kuldahar before, have you?~
@446  = ~No.  And I still cannot imagine life without Arundel, either.  Though you all make it so much more worthwhile, and less bleak.  It is a great blessing not to be alone in this hour.~
@447  = ~It is an honor to serve.  Your face is a living reminder of how much we have lost, and what we must regain.  I swore to give up my life for it, if need be, and I will.~
@448  = ~No.  There have been enough deaths.  It is time to shelter the living.~
@449  = ~Oh, real beds!  Oh, sunlight!~ [O#TER066]
@450  = ~I feel like a mower.  One priest, two, three... Now I understand the true meaning of the saying "flesh is grass".  It becomes a mechanical affair.~ [O#SEV064]
@451  = ~A few more days, and you are going to develop a very dark sense of humor, Severn.~ [O#NEL063]
@452  = ~I just need a release.  A reassurance.  I have to know what we are doing is not a bloody massacre.~
@453  = ~I can help.  Here, stand next to me: we will pray together.~
@454  = ~Pray?  Here and now?  Umm... all right.  Do I kneel?~
@455  = ~Shhh.  No.  Just repeat after me.~
@456  = ~I call to you, the Forest Father.  To you, the Great Mother.  Free these souls from the tormented cages of their bodies.  Let them pass the Wheel of Balance.  Let them exit the world whole, healed, unchanged.  Guide them to the Blessed Spirits in the Elysian Fields.  Let them find the rest they seek.~
@457  = ~Brothers in faith, depart in peace.  Let the spirit of Silvanus and the Seldarine guide you to Arvandor.~
@458  = ~Did you hear that?  There was... a sigh?~
@459  = ~I just saw something in the water!  A glimpse of gold, Tymora... no, I must have imagined it.~ [O#TER067]
@460  = ~I saw it, too.  When the waters ran pure, I thought I saw Evergold, Hanali's sacred pool.  Was it our reward?~ [O#KOR062]
@461  = ~Korin, do you remember our conversation in the House of the Broken Rose?  You promised to tell me about Hanali.~
@462  = ~So I did.  You are right, there is no better time.~
@463  = ~In my youth, I was very much in love.  Poems, night vigils on the stairs of Her temples, clinging to a lonely drop of rain on my cheek, thinking it was Her gift - the state of exaltation was my constant companion.~
@464  = ~Everything changed when I lost my gift of magic.  My dreams and passions ended.  Hanali did not follow me into exile.~
@465  = ~And you became a realist.  A shame: I would almost prefer you as you were before.  But that aside, what do you think of Hanali now?~
@466  = ~I still revere her.  She is a presence that watches over, a holy, benign force that makes lovers believe they will be together forever.  A force that makes it true.~
@467  = ~But Hanali herself is a personification of this force, isn't she?  It still makes her a woman.  So when you fall in love, will you fall in love with one woman, or two?~
@468  = ~Good question.~
@469  = ~Think on it.~
@470  = ~If the Order took part in the battle of the Hand, would things be different?~ [O#HOL064]
@471  = ~The Order cannot be everywhere.  Besides, there are too few of you in the Dale.~ [O#SEV065]
@472  = ~Yet the Order does too little.  We have been looped on our race, and paid too little attention to our neighbors and their pleas.  And often they did not ask us for help, since they expected none.  It has to change.~
@473  = ~Will you vie for a position of power in your Order, then?~
@474  = ~If I must, and if it comes to that.  But I have faith in my superiors.  Once civilization embarks on the frontier, and the Order establishes its headquarters in the Ten Towns, new alliances will be forged.~
@475  = ~And human, halfling, elf and dwarf will serve Tyr?  It would make a fanciful tale even for this bard.~
@476  = ~It is but a distant dream.  But one day, we will see it coming true.~
@477  = ~It seems that these elves were damn resourceful.~ [O#TER068]
@478  = ~Come again?  They are dead, in case you haven't noticed.  Or undead, as it were.~ [O#SEV066]
@479  = ~That's my point.  We have found good armor, shields, weapons, potions and scrolls, but very little gold, and only a few gems.~
@480  = ~Severn, open your eyes!  It was a major elven stronghold!  It should have a treasury or several, hidden chests, something!  I am not expecting signposts telling us to keep left if we want to enter the Jewelry Chamber, but can you believe in austere conditions for all?~
@481  = ~Unfortunately, according to the lore and elven traditions... yes, I do.  They might have been very good at concealment, or the robbers took their due.~
@482  = ~Damn.~
@483  = ~But if I find a signpost to Jewelry Chamber, I'll be sure to point it out to you.  I'd paint one, but I am out of jewels.~
@484  = ~Korin, what came over you?  You nearly let them chop your head off!~ [O#NEL064]
@485  = ~I am sorry for putting your lives at risk.  I shouldn't have-~ [O#KOR063]
@486  = ~No, I am sorry for lashing out.  If the village folk in Kuldahar went mad and attacked, I'd have felt the same.  Do not apologize.~
@487  = ~A thought frightens me.  Their minds were twisted with magic and time, eternal wandering in the dark.  What... what if Arvandor twists the spirit just as well?  And fields and lands of Arborea are filled with wandering madmen?  What if the Blessed Plane itself is as dead and barren as the garden before us?~
@488  = ~The gods would never allow it.  No, their spirits are hale in the lands beyond, just as these of your brethren.~
@489  = ~But their bodies lie here before me, tormented and broken.  What am I to think?~
@490  = ~Have faith.  And hope.~
@491  = ~This place is so sad.  I am desperately looking for something to cheer me up.~ [O#TER069]
@492  = ~Nella, I know it sounds clumsy, but I am sorry about Arundel's death.  It was cruel and unfair.  I remember how happy you seemed when we found the gem, how your eyes shone as you spoke of bringing it back, and...~ [O#KOR064]
@493  = ~... And when we came back, Kuldahar was beset by orogs, and Arundel lay dying.~ [O#NEL065]
@494  = ~Yes.  I doubt he wanted to be grieved about, but he will be remembered.~
@495  = ~There is too much grief in this place already, but I cannot think of Arundel with a smile.  Not yet.~
@496  = ~I hope one day that time will come.~
@497  = ~I wish it was upon me already.  I am tired of blinking back tears.~
@498  = ~You have not teased anyone for a while, Teri.  It is most unlike you.~ [O#HOL065]
@499  = ~A-ha, you fear that I am planning something nefarious!~ [O#TER070]
@500  = ~I was concerned about your wellbeing.  As for your plans, I am sure you will share them with us eventually.~
@501  = ~Now you say that I cannot keep a secret.  Talk about chivalrous paladins!  But you are right; I've been thinking.~
@502  = ~What is to happen to this place?  We will leave it, and what then?  Except the stray goblins and adventurers, I mean.~
@503  = ~It will continue to fall into ruin and disrepair.  It is a sad fate, but it is what must happen, if its inhabitants are to know peace.~
@504  = ~But they will leave.  The Seldarine will free them, and the place will be empty.  In a year, in twenty, in a hundred years.  It is a magnificent stronghold - won't anyone find a better use for it?~
@505  = ~Sometimes it is better to let the old wrongs lie.  Elves will not return here, and we will give this place a wide berth for many, many years.~
@506  = ~So everything they strived and labored for will be pointless?~
@507  = ~No.  Not while we remember.~
@508  = ~Ah!  It is so high!~ [O#NEL066]
@509  = ~I hope she is at peace.  Her final sacrifice puts me to shame.~ [O#KOR065]
@510  = ~Fresh air again!  Ah, this bridge reminds me of a fine ancient tradition.~ [O#SEV067]
@511  = ~Burning bridges?  Or repairing them?~ [O#TER071]
@512  = ~No, the one that happens after a wedding.  The one the new couple cements their devotion with.  Let me show you.  The groom picks the bride up, like so-~
@513  = ~Hey!  I'm afraid of heights!  All right, I'm not, but it's - you are not going to carry me across this bridge, are you?~
@514  = ~Hmm.  As the matter of fact...~
@515  = ~Woe is me, for I am undone... eh, not yet.  Oy, brave hero!  Save me from this villain's clutches!~
@516  = ~It is "heroine", actually.  Do you need help?~
@517  = ~Are you sure you want to be rescued?~
@518  = ~Severn, that's enough.  Put her down, please.~
@519  = ~I think you two look good together, actually.~
@520  = ~Cut it out.  We don't have time for this.~
@521  = ~That's the question!  I do not know.  Do you want to save me?~
@522  = ~Of course!  I want to carry you around myself!~
@523  = ~If you want me to.  Severn, put Teri down, please.~
@524  = ~Well, we do have a task to complete.~
@525  = ~I would rather leave it to Severn.~
@526  = ~As your friend and companion, and if you want me to, I will help.  But you do not seem to be in danger.~
@527  = ~Entirely hypothetically, what happens if I refuse?~
@528  = ~Let Teri answer the question.  Teri, what do you want?~
@529  = ~There may be violence.~
@530  = ~Nothing.  I simply tried to oblige her.~
@531  = ~I am sure Teri is in no real danger, and in any case, this is none of my business.~
@532  = ~Well, then, my bard!  Carry me through, and woe is everyone else!~
@533  = ~Your wish is my command, oh, lady fair!~
@534  = ~I suppose we really have to go.  Eh.  Then again, I wanted to be rescued.~
@535  = ~Worry not, lady.  I know quite a few ancient traditions...~
@536  = ~No, there won't.  Let me go, Severn.  And you - what are you playing at?~
@537  = ~Isn't it obvious?  I like you, and I am jealous.~
@538  = ~I thought he was going to hurt you, but if not, I will leave you two to your own devices.~
@539  = ~So much for gratitude.~
@540  = ~O-ho!  Severn, you have a powerful rival!~
@541  = ~A duel!  Ah, but I cannot fight with a beautiful lady on my shoulder.~
@542  = ~What does this inscription mean?  Here, on the door?  Labelas... time... ah.  We are in the tower of Labelas Enoreth.~ [O#SEV068]
@543  = ~The deity of longevity, time and knowledge.  This is why this tower was able to withstand the worst ravages of time.~ [O#KOR066]
@544  = ~So did its inhabitants, then.  And, given our past experiences, they will not be friendly.~
@545  = ~We are in the mage quarters.  Here we may find recordings and scrolls that will tell us more of what transpired here.  You, too, will be able to acquire much knowledge for your tales, Severn, if this is what you seek.~
@546  = ~You are not worried that we are about to find a fireball or two, as well?~
@547  = ~I am.  Nevertheless, I feel home.~
@548  = ~Lucky you.  If only the elves felt it prudent to include a couple of farms into the picture, I could echo your statement.~
@549  = ~You are still luckier than me.  No one shall take your art from you.~
@550  = ~Except for a good silence spell.  Which brings us back to mages and fireballs.  Shall we proceed to check which one of us was right?~
@551  = ~This chamber... it is almost an exact copy of my room in the Academy.~ [O#KOR067]
@552  = ~I have learnt of this citadel from books.  And now I am in its library; it is amazing.~ [O#HOL066]
@553  = ~Underground, underground...  Glaciers, villages, snow passes, these I can understand.  An old ruin?  That's stretching, but if we have to, that's where we go.  But then we head into a dungeon, then another and another.~ [O#SEV069]
@554  = ~I never thought caves could be so beautiful.~ [O#KOR068]
@555  = ~As if I was a child again, opening my mouth in wonder...~ [O#NEL067]
@556  = ~Your mouth is open in wonder.~
@557  = ~Well, so is yours.~
@558  = ~Ha.  Fair enough.~
@559  = ~I never imagined... I simply never imagined.~
@560  = ~I imagine it gets old after a while.  Repetitive.~
@561  = ~Hardly.  Not for me, at any rate.~
@562  = ~Having seen so much, and knowing there is more, will I find the strength to return to Kuldahar?~
@563  = ~We choose our fates.~
@564  = ~This is exactly what scares me.~
@565  = ~You look wonderfully thoughtful in this light, Teri.~ [O#SEV070]
@566  = ~Plotting mischief, as always.  Do I sense longing in your voice?~ [O#TER072]
@567  = ~I am content with being your friend, but I cannot steer my heart clear of you, lady.  Scorn me if you will, but you will not find a servant so devoted, a friend so true...~
@568  = ~Or a tongue as long?  But you made me smile.  Thanks.~
@569  = ~Yet I sense a warning in your voice.  It must mean my time has not yet come.  Well!  I shall spend it in silent vigil, polishing the verses so poignant a mere thought of them would break any maiden's heart.  Mind you, I am suffering.~
@570  = ~I'll keep it in mind.  It is just your luck I am the most infamous sadist in these waters - er, dungeons, though.~
@571  = ~Heheh.  You know, I never thought being constantly rejected could be *this* entertaining.~
@572  = ~You bet!~
@573  = ~Nella, I've long wanted to ask - the book you read at rest...~ [O#HOL067]
@574  = ~This one?  It is called Alaundo's Tales.~ [O#NEL068]
@575  = ~The prophecies?  I would have never thought you were a scholar.~
@576  = ~And right you are: I am not.  These are just tales for children.  The one I am reading now is about a prince who was fighting for his love and happiness in a far away kingdom.~
@577  = ~You are a romantic, Nella.  But we both are; you said so yourself.  How does it end?~
@578  = ~He wins the war, thwarts evil and receives his love and his desire.  Yet even as he is about to enter the bedroom where the princess, his wife, is waiting for him, an old man appears in his way.~
@579  = ~"You won, my prince.  But the kingdom lies in ruin and without a ruler, and people suffer.  You won, and by law you must become King of this land."~
@580  = ~"But I only wanted to find my love and happiness.  Now the princess and I are together, and I am leaving."~
@581  = ~But he could not leave, for the land was now his, and he had to do his duty, and to rule it wisely.~
@582  = ~"But you cannot leave.  For this land is now yours, and you have to do your duty, and to rule it wisely."~
@583  = ~"With these words, the old man crowned the prince with a heavy tiara, bowed deeply and stepped back.  And the young king, deep in thought, stepped over the threshold and entered the bedroom, where his wife awaited him."~
@584  = ~We may find love and happiness, but we will be inevitably confronted with duty.  And who knows... We may find the burden too hard to bear.~
@585  = ~Look, a campfire!  How about a short break?~ [O#TER073]
@586  = ~I am sure the orcs will appreciate the company.~ [O#KOR069]
@587  = ~I don't think I'd even mind the smell; I am too tired.  It has been a long march to Dorn's Deep, and kneeling near the dying embers is so... tempting?~
@588  = ~Why, Teri.  How can you not be eager to explore the perils ahead?~
@589  = ~But what if I am in love?  I would sit near the fire and stare at his profile, and picture my lips kissing his temples...~
@590  = ~The way you look at a certain someone, you would not mind curling near the fire with her, either.~
@591  = ~You are free to express the ways of your heart, but I would rather you did not speak of what I do not know myself.~
@592  = ~In any case, I am sure the orcs will find it very romantic.~
@593  = ~Hey, that was my line!~
@594  = ~I try my best.~
@595  = ~The horrible plight of elves and dwarves made me rethink my views.  In Kuldahar, humans live in peace with other races, perhaps because there are so few people.  A lone adventurer, a peddler, an occasional guest, perhaps.~ [O#NEL069]
@596  = ~We meet heroes and villains and great men on our way, but it is the death of an ordinary man, who may have never strived to become a hero, that is the most bitter.~ [O#HOL068]
@597  = ~Tell me something.  Where are the dwarves?~ [O#NEL070]
@598  = ~Gone?  Dead?  Driven out further into the depths by these creatures, most probably.~ [O#SEV071]
@599  = ~But these creatures move and act as if they had a purpose.  Do you remember the orog at the entrance?~
@600  = ~Oh, yes.  Smart fellow.  You think he's been given orders, don't you?~
@601  = ~"Down beneath..."  I think of the deep dwarves and the drow, and I do not like it at all.  If the drow race stands behind the attacks on Kuldahar, the peril is greater than I may have imagined.~
@602  = ~Not the entire drow race, surely.  From what I've heard, the drow fight and squabble like spiders in a pot.~
@603  = ~Wait, what?  We will be heading to the Underdark?~
@604  = ~I think we are doomed.~
@605  = ~If each mission had a halfway point, we'd be approaching ours.~ [O#KOR070]
@606  = ~I hope not: we lingered in the Hand long enough.  I would like to think we are approaching our destination.~ [O#HOL069]
@607  = ~Either way, we've gone far.  Strange, I thought we met in Easthaven Inn only yesterday, and yet it seems so long ago.~
@608  = ~Easthaven...  Will we see it again?~
@609  = ~Corellon only knows.  I'd like to see how Jhonen is faring these days.~
@610  = ~As long as we give Old Jed a wide berth.  Tyr forgive me, but my patience is not limitless.~
@611  = ~I'd still take him over the drow and darkness.  For these lightless caves, I need all the resolve I can muster.~
@612  = ~There will be a sunrise.  I only wish I knew the hour.~
@613  = ~What are we doing here?~ [O#KOR071]
@614  = ~I beg your pardon?  I can sing you a ballad of the gallant saviors of Kuldahar to refresh your memory.~ [O#SEV072]
@615  = ~No, I was just thinking...  Did you ever feel that you were born for a higher fate?~
@616  = ~Every day!  Especially during dinner.  "Severn," I say.  "You were not born to munch on this grub.  No, there must be a higher pur-"~
@617  = ~Severn!  I am serious.~
@618  = ~Yes, I have this feeling from time to time.  But I have accomplished much, and I will do more.~
@619  = ~I sometimes feel uncomfortable, when I remember I am just a boy from a backwater farm.  Then it passes, and I am myself again.~
@620  = ~Yes, you only have to rise, but I feel as if I keep falling.  I used to wear fine clothes, spend hours over old folios, wield power, expect greatness.  Now my hands are roughened, my belongings are scarce, and my new trade is hardly inspiring.~
@621  = ~Yet I do good.  I must remember it.  Seldarine, it's just like stumbling in the dark: a step forward, two steps back.  Will I ever live without regrets?~
@622  = ~Not if you are going to live a long life.~
@623  = ~What, another journal?  Everyone seems to want to leave an imprint.~ [O#TER074]
@624  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you think I am ceremonious?~ [O#HOL070]
@625  = ~Where did that come from?~
@626  = ~Yes, you are.~
@627  = ~Not as much now, but it was pretty bad when we set out from Easthaven.~
@628  = ~No, not at all.  Why?~
@629  = ~Holvir, we do not have time for this now.~
@630  = ~This circle of runes looks just like the one on the table in the next room, doesn't it?  Only... no, it is different.~ [O#NEL071]
@631  = ~Grrum, brrum, aaand - I step into the circle without fear!  Phew, I thought we were done for.~ [O#SEV073]
@632  = ~You were done for, you mean.  Trying to rush through the floor like that!  You should thank Teriel the Magnificent for holding you back *and* keeping you alive.~ [O#TER075]
@633  = ~Indeed?  The lady flatters me with her attention, though I cannot fathom why she would bother.~
@634  = ~Perhaps she cannot imagine waking up and not seeing your face.  Or, perhaps, waking up and not hearing you snore on the other side of the camp?  Take your pick.~
@635  = ~I don't snore!  I-I was probably rehearsing.  Anyway, that's neither here nor there.  Stop interrupting our leader, please.~
@636  = ~Pfft!~
@637  = ~Holvir, excuse my impertinence... you are unmarried, are you not?~ [O#KOR072]
@638  = ~This is true.~ [O#HOL071]
@639  = ~I have heard that paladins pledge themselves to the Church.  Some marry, but spend months away from their families; some leave the Order.  And some choose yet another fate, perhaps.  I wondered what was the case with you.~
@640  = ~I took no additional vows, but from the moment I joined the Order, my life ceased being my own.  Tyr's will be done: I will follow wherever my church bids me to follow.~
@641  = ~By my faith and troth, I cannot marry while I serve Tyr, and I intend to serve Him until I die.~
@642  = ~So simple and so cruel.~
@643  = ~Yet love finds its way into every heart.  You yourself should know, Korin.~
@644  = ~Now, why do these words sound so ominous?~
@645  = ~Nella, do you think such a thing as a friendly rivalry may exist?~ [O#TER076]
@646  = ~Friendly rivalry?  Where did that come from?~ [O#NEL072]
@647  = ~Oh, nowhere, nowhere.  I've caught myself comparing my number of kills with yours and wondered.~
@648  = ~A number of kills?  That's a rather bloodthirsty rivalry.  Teri, you do not mean something else, do you?~
@649  = ~Me?  No, not at all.~
@650  = ~Someone's affection, perhaps?~
@651  = ~Well... maybe.  But never mind that now, there is more.~
@652  = ~It is just... you are so sure of yourself.  So wondrously calm.  And I am jealous.  Sometimes.~
@653  = ~You are quick-witted, light-hearted, beautiful and funny.  If someone should be envious, it is anyone but you.~
@654  = ~Well... thanks?~
@655  = ~Still not a single dwarf, and a cold forge.  Were I a sentimental type, I'd burst into tears, but even as it is, it's still depressing.~ [O#SEV074]
@656  = ~Did you believe Larrel's words?  That the dwarves were responsible for the betrayal, and their ruin was the price?~ [O#KOR073]
@657  = ~I have no reason to *dis*believe him.  But he lost his daughter.  He failed his people.~
@658  = ~He is bitter, you mean to say?  Yet he seemed to be sincere.~
@659  = ~And he is your kinsman.~
@660  = ~I do not dislike dwarves, nor had I thought them to be capable of betrayal, before I heard Larrel's words.  But now... now I am wary.~
@661  = ~I'll be honest: so am I.~
@662  = ~Uh-oh.  Trouble.  Holvir, you won't mind if I step behind your broad-shouldered back, will you?~ [O#TER077]
@663  = ~What is wrong, Teri?  I have not seen you afraid before.~ [O#HOL072]
@664  = ~I feel sick today, that's why.  Spend some time in a dark corner in the hold of the ship, then spend the next month without a single day of rest, and you'll feel veeery comfortable underground.  Word.~
@665  = ~Teri... I am sorry.  Here, you can use my, ah, broad-shouldered back all you want.  If you wish, I will lend you my cloak, as well.  Here...~
@666  = ~Argh, it is so irritating when people are fussing over me!  But pleasant.  Um, please pretend that you haven't heard the last bit.~
@667  = ~Hmm?  What was that?~
@668  = ~Exactly.~
@669  = ~You shine so much more these days, Nella.  With all you came through, it must be difficult.~ [O#KOR074]
@670  = ~Thank you, Korin.  It is, but with each new day, it becomes easier.~ [O#NEL073]
@671  = ~Especially among the gathering skeletons.~
@672  = ~Well, skeletons follow us wherever you go.  But I appreciate your humor.~
@673  = ~My pleasure.  Although I look forward to seeing the sky again.~
@674  = ~And so do I.  But not as much as I look forward to learning who "RBP" is.~
@675  = ~Ah, the mysterious man who signed the note on Krilag's corpse.  I wonder, too.~
@676  = ~Something tells me we will meet him again.  And if I should lock my grief away and steel myself in front of an army of gathering undead, I shall do so.  Arundel will be avenged.~
@677  = ~He will be.  But I think of his words about submitting to the will of Ilmater, and I am almost afraid.  Followers of the deity of mercy and suffering do not employ drow and orogs.  It will not be easy.~
@678  = ~No, it will not be easy, but now we know the way.  And if it is suffering he seeks, he will have it.~
@679  = ~Speaking of looting, I feel as if it is time to be ashamed again, even though we have the key.  Fallen heroes lie here.  Will we rummage in their tombs?~ [O#SEV075]
@680  = ~We shall, because we must: the phylactery lies here.  Besides, would they begrudge us, if we pick up their weapons to continue their fight?~ [O#HOL073]
@681  = ~You have an answer to every question.~
@682  = ~This is my duty.~
@683  = ~Looters suffer a grave punishment in Evereska, but magical items of worth are passed down the generations among my people.  I agree with Holvir: there is no shame in this.~
@684  = ~It seems that I do not know the right from wrong anymore.~
@685  = ~You are right, too: tradition and vanity often call for luxurious burials, which are unnecessary.  Great warriors are buried in full armor and regalia, but it only attracts looters years and centuries hence.~
@686  = ~Looters like us?~
@687  = ~Worse.  We are driving an evil presence away from these halls; those I speak about bring it.~
@688  = ~I see the other side of the picture now, but you still have not convinced me.~
@689  = ~Ask Teri, then: she will convince you in no time.  No, no, I was joking, of course.  Decide for yourself, Severn.  You are your own best judge.~
@690  = ~Decide for yourself, Severn.  You are your own best judge.~
@691  = ~Evayne was a true daughter of her people.  We should let Larrel know of her doom at once.~ [O#NEL074]
@692  = ~Larrel would be... will be proud of her.  It is sad, isn't it?  The girl is dead, and nobody will visit her grave - wait.  Her grave.  Somebody buried her, tended to her body.  Who?~ [O#TER078]
@693  = ~Not the undead, surely?  I wonder.  Oh, but I pity Larrel.~
@694  = ~So do I.  His is a tragic story.~
@695  = ~It seems like we are walking over the remains of grand stories.  Jerrod's, Hrothgar's, Arundel's, Larrel's, now Dorn's Deep.  Which story will be told now?~
@696  = ~Our own?~
@697  = ~You have a high opinion of yourself, but so do I.  So be it then.  Our own!~
@698  = ~Undead, undead and undead!  And to think they have a longer unlife than we do.  It is unfair.~ [O#TER079]
@699  = ~How now, you no longer wish to spend an eternity as a wandering, free spirit?~ [O#SEV076]
@700  = ~The idea is still attractive, but just as an idea.  The implementation desires better.  Besides, do you remember Larrel's voice?  Deep and breathtakingly attractive, but the shell!  Hideous.~
@701  = ~And you want to be admired.~
@702  = ~Yes.  I do not relish the thought of you fleeing from my newly acquired immortal form in disgust, for one.~
@703  = ~Hmm.  There was a compliment in there somewhere...~
@704  = ~Ah, the forge is working again.  It looks like our task is done, yet I feel no satisfaction.~ [O#KOR075]
@705  = ~Holvir, your cloak is smouldering!~ [O#NEL075]
@706  = ~What - no!  Where?~ [O#HOL074]
@707  = ~Here, let me help.  You should not have approached the forge this closely.~
@708  = ~I had to see for myself:  I was curious.  Weren't you?~
@709  = ~You would be curious if it were a dragon, I do not doubt.  Paladins...~
@710  = ~"Boys", I think you meant?~
@711  = ~Well... yes.  There is something very boyish in you, despite your solemn manner.~
@712  = ~This is possibly the best compliment anyone has ever paid me.  A pity about the cloak, though: it appears to be ruined.~
@713  = ~We will get you a new one.  With dragons on it.~
@714  = ~So, it looks like we are about to get out of here at last.~ [O#TER080]
@715  = ~Ah, to be young, in love, and outdoors!  With joy I celebrate this day.~ [O#SEV077]
@716  = ~The trolls do not appear to share your point of view.  Oh, you said you were in love?~ [O#KOR076]
@717  = ~With the whole world, and one wayward rogue.  Aren't you?~
@718  = ~With the whole world!  Aren't you?~
@719  = ~Not quite with the whole world, I'm afraid.  But it is good to be outdoors again.~
@720  = ~It is somewhat cold, though.  Why must we always lose something to gain something?  I breathe fresh air, but the way the wind blows, we'll be chilled to the bone in no time.~
@721  = ~Why, such is the price of love.~
@722  = ~I know I can always count on you to brighten my day, Korin.~
@723  = ~Look at this place!  What happened here?~ [O#TER081]
@724  = ~It looks like a piece of machinery went out of order.  It was supposed to heat the aquariums, but with the dwarves gone, it fell into disrepair.~ [O#HOL075]
@725  = ~All the little fishes are frozen...~
@726  = ~That's what Auril's priestess wanted to make of Kuldahar.  Isn't it?  She already achieved her goal here, then.~
@727  = ~But not in Kuldahar.  We cannot do anything here, but we will not let anyone turn the Great Oak into a frozen mortuary.~
@728  = ~Uh-huh.  Blessed are the hopeful, for they usually die before learning the truth.~
@729  = ~Teri, we will NOT die.~
@730  = ~Right, now write it down, sign and seal it.  I'll show the result to the next enemy we meet.~
@731  = ~<CHARNAME>, look, this is the snow falling!  For the very first time since I arrived to the Dale, too.  Beautiful.~ [O#HOL076]
@732  = ~So peaceful.  You almost expect to stumble upon a dwarven priest, hurrying somewhere with his arms full of scrolls.~ [O#SEV078]
@733  = ~You paint a pretty picture.  But, yes, I can just see it.  I often wished I was raised in a real temple, with Arundel as my mentor.~ [O#NEL076]
@734  = ~Do you feel you lacked structure, or discipline?~
@735  = ~I never lacked guidance.  But I missed the feeling of belonging to a part of the whole.~
@736  = ~But this is precisely what the problem is, with schooling in temples: they train you, they accustom you to the notion they'll always be there, and then, one day, they aren't.~
@737  = ~True.  But there is experience.~
@738  = ~And loneliness.~
@739  = ~Ah!  So you're missing it, too!~
@740  = ~Damn, I've been discovered!  Ahhh, to have fallen for your trap so easily, it was unforgivable.~
@741  = ~There is no shame in revealing your true feelings.  Still, we are a part of the whole - our party.  Let's make it last.~
@742  = ~It is such a pity we will never know what was in these books.~ [O#HOL077]
@743  = ~Age, and water, and age again.  Even tablets of stone and diamond crumble: nothing is eternal.~ [O#KOR077]
@744  = ~No, recordings may cease to be, but the words of gods are there to be heard.~
@745  = ~Perhaps these gods are long dead, just like the statue in the hall.  Just like mortals, gods expire and wink out of existence.  What if Tyr ceases to be, Holvir?  Have you ever thought of it?~
@746  = ~It will not happen in my time.  And even if it does, faith and justice will not disappear; neither will truth and honor.~
@747  = ~Why is it so maddening to hear you spouting platitudes?~
@748  = ~Because they mean something to you?  Because you are clinging to them, as well, afraid to lose them and unwilling to let go?  Or the truth is that you see me as a rival, and you are unable to see my words for what they are.~
@749  = ~Because they mean something to you?  Because you are clinging to them, as well, afraid to lose them and unwilling to let go?~
@750  = ~A rival, no.  I know you serve Tyr, and you shall not allow yourself to attach your mind, body and soul to one woman.  But you have come to love.~
@751  = ~We... will talk another time.~
@752  = ~Who are we?  What do we want?  Has the question ever occurred to you, <CHARNAME>?~ [O#SEV079]
@753  = ~Imagine, if we die in this cave, they will never find our bodies.~ [O#TER082]
@754  = ~Nonsense, Teri.  You have been far too morose lately.~ [O#NEL077]
@755  = ~I am going through an identity crisis.~
@756  = ~In other words, you are tired, and you want to go home.~
@757  = ~It *has* been a long journey.  A change of scenery would be welcome.  Don't you want to go to Kuldahar again?~
@758  = ~I do.  Especially now, when...~
@759  = ~... When you'd like to spend some time with someone you care about, among the grass and glades?~
@760  = ~Perhaps.  But I am not ready for... for anything.  It is much too soon.~
@761  = ~Then we have a situation here.  You see, I am supposed to yank your hair, instead of nodding compassionately.  And I am not that good at compassion.  Pulling hair, though - any time.  Just ask.~
@762  = ~Nella?  Are you all right?~
@763  = ~... When Arundel's grave is there.  I would like to remember him, the best I can.  And, Teri... if you stand there with me, I will be grateful.~
@764  = ~Of... of course.  I will be honored.  All right, you are ready to go to Kuldahar, so am I, all that remains is to tell our leader.  Hmm... time to find a volunteer!~
@765  = ~And we have his badge!  Well done.  I hope you will not view it as looting this time, Severn.~ [O#HOL078]
@766  = ~Heh, my obsession with looting has become a running joke.  Well, that's the disadvantage of having the proverbial innocent on board.~ [O#SEV080]
@767  = ~We are happy to have you on board, Severn.~
@768  = ~So am I.  I'd have never met you, and our funny and mysterious leader, and the others... it's been a hell of a ride.  Now, do you think the giants will blame us if we, ah, check those bags up the corridor?~
@769  = ~Were it another ancient elven stronghold, I might have qualms.  But not here.~
@770  = ~Good, then we are of one mind.  This bard's influence must be corrupting you, eh?~
@771  = ~Not as such, but I am sure you could teach me many things.~
@772  = ~Like watching your pockets?  Here, hide your holy symbol somewhere safe.  Don't look at me like that: in the end, I'm just giving you more opportunities to redeem me.  Let's loot!~
@773  = ~Good riddance.  Auril will not pass here.~ [O#KOR078]
@774  = ~Where do we go from here?~ [O#SEV081]
@775  = ~Down, eventually.  The letter spoke of six badges, remember.~ [O#TER083]
@776  = ~It is going to be dangerous, you know.~
@777  = ~I know.  Are you trying to tell me something?~
@778  = ~Yes and no.  What if I tell you I am jealous of someone, who is also a friend of mine?~
@779  = ~I'll tell you that you have nothing to be jealous of, since we.  Are.  Friends.~
@780  = ~Then I'll raise an eyebrow eloquently, and ask you: Teriel Gilethir, do you know who holds your heart?~
@781  = ~But I will not answer.~
@782  = ~Because you do not know.  Fair enough.~
@783  = ~What?  No.  Do you think I am worried for you?  Me?~
@784  = ~You might be.  Otherwise why would your hands tremble?~
@785  = ~Because it's cold?  You never know.~
@786  = ~Pfft!  You are worried for me, Severn of the Sword Coast, and that's the truth.~
@787  = ~Or maybe I am simply unwilling to go underground again, and I am hiding it under a mask of concern for your wellbeing?~
@788  = ~Ha, maybe so!  But thank you anyway.~
@789  = ~So!  I don't know about you, but I think it's a good time for a meal.~ [O#SEV082]
@790  = ~Why not?  It's hot, there's no need to stoke a fire.  Pity we haven't got any eggs.~
@791  = ~Are you two serious?~
@792  = ~Of course.  We have to eat somewhere, Nella!~
@793  = ~It doesn't seem that bad an idea...~
@794  = ~Especially when you add a bottle of wine and a bard willing to sing, eh?~
@795  = ~Seriously, this is a bad place.  There's something really evil here, close, and we'll need all our vigor.  Why not raise it?~
@796  = ~While we still can?  We may as well give it a try.  Teri, what have you got?~
@797  = ~Let me see.  Raisins, some rice... two old carrots... and some dried meat.  And bread, but you seriously don't want to touch it.~
@798  = ~Ah.  Hmm.  It seems to me it will be an *extremely* good idea to move on and to find some supplies.~
@799  = ~Agreed.~
@800  = ~Onward, then!~
@801  = ~You were crying last night, Nella.~ [O#HOL079]
@802  = ~So I was.  Bad memories, you see.~ [O#NEL078]
@803  = ~Some losses are not easy to forget.~
@804  = ~Say "impossible", and you will be right.  I remember the story you told us once, of a burning city.  You haven't forgotten it, either, have you?~
@805  = ~It is a part of me now.  I know what it feels like, which is why I asked.  Nella, if there is anything I can do, or if you wish to talk to me about it, do so.  It will get easier.~
@806  = ~You need to help yourself first.  You've been living with this pain for so many years, never letting go.  I do not want to live like that.~
@807  = ~This pain will always be with me, as long as injustice and cruelty are here.  The burning city is just a symbol.  My pain is my duty, and I will not let go of it.~
@808  = ~But if it is your duty, why do you need a reminder?~
@809  = ~Another salamander, and, oh, my clothes, my poor clothes.~ [O#TER084]
@810  = ~What kind of scum preys on the helpless?~ [O#SEV083]
@811  = ~The worst kind, obviously.  This is a nasty wound in your shoulder.~ [O#KOR079]
@812  = ~I'll live.  And the girl, did you see her?  It's... it's...~
@813  = ~Unfathomable, yes.  Severn, is this supposed to be an exchange about the general depravity of this place, or... ?~
@814  = ~Just venting my anger.  You of all people should know: you saw that elven girl in Severed Hand.~
@815  = ~I was shocked and sad rather than angry, but I understand your point.  Still, shout, or hit this wall, but things do not change.  Let us move forward.~
@816  = ~Korin, you... you are envious!  Yes, you are - you, too, would like to scream, shout and express pure, unadulterated anger, but you restrain yourself.  Why?~
@817  = ~Because I am ashamed for my previous outbursts.  My behavior in the Hand was too emotional, and it didn't help anyone.  You could benefit from my mistakes.~
@818  = ~Hmm.  You are entitled to your opinion, Korin, but... I'd better go tend to that wound.~
@819  = ~We haven't talked for a while, and for a good reason.  I had much to think about.~ [O#NEL079]
@820  = ~This is a very sad place.~ [O#NEL080]
@821  = ~These poor workers... in a way, they are even more dead than my brethren in the Hand.~
@822  = ~I wonder what would have happened if the union between elves and dwarves held true.~
@823  = ~Same thing, possibly worse.  There is something VERY powerful at work here.  Have you noticed that our elusive enemy employs umber hulks, orogs, ice and fire salamanders, frost giants, ettins and Tymora knows what else?~
@824  = ~Then how can we hope to defeat him?~
@825  = ~Search me.~
@826  = ~You are all forgetting that his troops are disorganized, and easily disrupted.  It's as if our enemy doesn't care.~
@827  = ~Or, perhaps, he has other plans.~
@828  = ~Involving what?~
@829  = ~Given what has already happened to Kuldahar and Arundel, something sinister.  But this time we won't let it close to what we hold dear.~
@830  = ~Now all we need to do is find him and tell him that.  I just hope we won't end up like these hapless souls here.~
@831  = ~You are clutching your chest again, Korin.  What has happened?~ [O#HOL080]
@832  = ~Well, six hundred pounds of umber hulk do this to you.~ [O#KOR080]
@833  = ~Ah.  I am sorry; I hadn't noticed, as I was-~
@834  = ~... Covering our leader on the other side, yes, I know.  I should have been by your side instead of enjoying a one-on-one with the beast, so there is nothing else to talk about.~
@835  = ~Except that you take her safety very seriously, which is, of course, only commendable.~
@836  = ~She is very important to me, just as she is to you.  But that was not my point.~
@837  = ~I am worried one of your ribs may be broken.  We should apply healing just in case.~
@838  = ~Paladin's patented methods, laying on of hands and the like?  Holvir, I can heal myself.~
@839  = ~Of course, but I can do it quicker and easier.  Stand still.  And... here you are.~
@840  = ~*sigh* Thank you.  Whenever you get lost in the forest, I won't be found wanting.~
@841  = ~Wait.  It *is* easier: I do not feel the pain at all, and there is no residue or weakness, either.  After divine healing, I feel drained and empty for hours.  How do you do it?~
@842  = ~Magic?~
@843  = ~These days, I feel as if Tyr looks at me with favor.  I have become a stronger warrior and a better healer.~ [O#HOL081]
@844  = ~Finally, the answer.  But I do not believe it.  One merchant, responsible for thousands of lost lives?~ [O#KOR081]
@845  = ~I don't believe it, either, though he tried very hard.  But he started it; orcs and goblins finished it.~ [O#TER085]
@846  = ~Dorn's Deep is now taken by the enemy.  And our people... gone.~
@847  = ~Larrel's tale, and the history of Dorn's Deep... It's funny how these two stories intersected, isn't it?~
@848  = ~Not especially, no.  I wonder where Yxunomei comes into picture.  Do you remember the Dragon Eye?~
@849  = ~Of course!  We argued whether she was in league with our mysterious enemy or not.~
@850  = ~Soon we will know.  But after this revelation, knowing that a single drow is capable of that much destruction... is it even worth it?~
@851  = ~Yes.  When you finish your introspection, there's a house up the street that looks both comfortable and empty.  You'll feel better after a meal and a rest.~
@852  = ~Shall we rest here?  A quiet, peaceful place - what more can one wish for?~ [O#KOR082]
@853  = ~This garden must have been beautiful a few seasons ago.~ [O#NEL081]
@854  = ~Underground, without sun and fresh air?  It would be a dying beauty.~ [O#SEV084]
@855  = ~True, but nevertheless.... I imagine that kings of old walked here.~
@856  = ~And dwarven bards sang songs of old.  What are you getting at, Lady Nella?~
@857  = ~I am simply sad to see it gone.~
@858  = ~In the towers of Severed Hand, you comforted me with a prayer.  Now I wish to comfort you with a song.~
@859  = ~Severn, you do not have to.~
@860  = ~I know I do not have to.  But listen...~
@861  = ~Severn, you are making far too much noise.~ [O#HOL082]
@862  = ~Oh, I hadn't noticed.  Your armor clinks quite inaudibly, by the way.~ [O#SEV085]
@863  = ~But I am not rolling my sleeves, whistling a melody and scraping the floor with the tip of my sword at the same time.~
@864  = ~I am preparing a spell!  But the sword was just above my - oh, I can't believe my belt undid itself again!  I hope it doesn't mean I have anything hanging out of my trousers...~
@865  = ~Not yet, but trust me, it's hanging by a thread.~
@866  = ~Hells.  Now... now, that's better.  Thank you.  Wait... was that a polite, paladin-y way to tell me I was about to have my bottom hanging out of my trousers?~
@867  = ~I am sure I do not know what you are talking about.  But... yes.  Close enough.~
@868  = ~Thanks.  When your codpiece starts tinkling, I'll tell you at once.~
@869  = ~I am *quite* sure we do not need to know that.~
@870  = ~Shall we discuss our tactics?~ [O#NEL082]
@871  = ~Would that be "barging in, taking everyone out", or has something changed?~
@872  = ~We could employ stealth, lest Marketh summons more mercenaries.~
@873  = ~Hey, whatever happened to playing fair?~
@874  = ~It is called survival.~
@875  = ~Whatever we do, I would rather employ some protective magics first.~
@876  = ~Nooo!  It will just mean more standing around!~
@877  = ~The alternative is becoming dead very quickly.  Holvir, will you help?~
@878  = ~Dear commander, this is your cue to shout "Charge!", or we'll be stuck here all day.~
@879  = ~You know, Teri, this is a bearskin rug...~ [O#SEV086]
@880  = ~And?  What's so special about a bearskin rug?~ [O#TER086]
@881  = ~Well... there might be something wrong with me, but it's tantalizing to imagine naked maidens on it.~
@882  = ~All right, but what do I have to do with it?  Do I steal their clothes while you charm them, or what?~
@883  = ~*sigh* Don't mind me.  I am seeing naked maidens everywhere, these days.~
@884  = ~A perfectly natural phenomenon.~
@885  = ~Marketh is gone.  We have done well.~ [O#KOR083]
@886  = ~Slavery.  Yet another side of evil.~ [O#NEL083]
@887  = ~I was sold into slavery once.  It wasn't pleasant.~ [O#TER087]
@888  = ~You?  No!  How come?~
@889  = ~That's the downside of growing up with adventuring parents.  Or the main advantage, depending on how you view it.~
@890  = ~Our ship was taken by the pirates of Moonsea, and they were surprisingly lenient.  True, we had all our possessions stolen, but nobody died, and we were fortunate in that my father's friends knew where we were going.  Angry elves, well... let's say we didn't remain slaves for long.~
@891  = ~A pretty story.  I am serious when I say that: I would disbelieve if it were anyone but you, but there is such fondness in your voice when you recall these memories...~
@892  = ~They are dear to me.  But... oh.  I've just realized: our own actions... freeing slaves... destroying Yxunomei...~
@893  = ~It feels just as if somebody's dropped a hammer on my head: we've done more than my parents have in their time.  I cannot believe it.~
@894  = ~And it may or may not be true.  Your father and mother have been adventuring for years; we only set out recently.  But you have overgrown their shadow.~
@895  = ~A dead city underground.  I have never seen such a pitiful sight.~ [O#SEV087]
@896  = ~Teri?  Have you checked the traps?~ [O#HOL083]
@897  = ~Actually, you are standing on one.~ [O#TER088]
@898  = ~Ha!  You jumped, you jumped!~
@899  = ~Don't joke like that.~
@900  = ~I had to see it!  A mighty paladin, jumping in full battle gear!  You were impressive, too.  A veritable symbol of masculinity!~
@901  = ~Teri, please...~
@902  = ~And now you're blushing!  Oh, that's too - mmph!  Let me spe-mmmph!~
@903  = ~There.  That's better.  Now, please, check the traps.~
@904  = ~I've never felt so powerless.  When Malavon threatened to kill the hostages, my heart went right down to my knees.  But he didn't get away with it.~ [O#NEL084]
@905  = ~We made him see the error of his ways, I would say.  But it was horrible, regardless.~ [O#KOR084]
@906  = ~He knew how we would react.  Somehow, it was worst of all.~
@907  = ~It was an atrocity.  Today I saw the side of evil I've never been exposed to before.  Now I know I'll never succumb, ever again.  No power is worth it.~
@908  = ~You've never succumbed to it, from what I know.~
@909  = ~I wanted to.  I wanted control and power, and it was just as bad.  And then I lost everything.~
@910  = ~Nella, you are a woman of faith, much like me.  Could my loss of magic be inflicted by Hanali, do you think?~
@911  = ~It would be too strong an intervention.  As a warning, perhaps?~
@912  = ~No, a precaution against evils I could have committed.~
@913  = ~This is not impossible.  But if it is so, your gift will return to you, Korin.  Have hope.~
@914  = ~You'll be surprised, but I want to ask you something else highly personal.~ [O#TER089]
@915  = ~It's so... so hot.~ [O#HOL084]
@916  = ~Mmm.  Too hot.  I thought the bathhouse was the other way?~ [O#SEV088]
@917  = ~Stop quipping, can't you see that he doesn't look well!  Holvir, what is wrong?~
@918  = ~It's so hot... as if the whole of Waterdeep is on fire again.  I've been fighting against it... but I need rest... soon.~
@919  = ~It's a surprise you've been holding on for so long.  You should have told!  Do you need anything?  Some water, a massage, somebody to carry your backpack?~
@920  = ~I would like to officially note I've *never* been offered a massage before, even when I was on the brink of death.~
@921  = ~Excuse me, but what good would it be on the brink of death?~
@922  = ~Pleasant memories?  Anyway, Holvir, I can carry your backpack, if you like.~
@923  = ~There's no need... oh.  Never mind.~
@924  = ~See?  Now you've dropped it.  All right, let's kill whoever is here quickly, so we can get somewhere cooler.~
@925  = ~This woman was just as bad as a priestess of Auril.  So much anger and hate!~ [O#NEL085]
@926  = ~What is going on here?~ [O#HOL085]
@927  = ~Phew!  Is this really over?~ [O#TER090]
@928  = ~Close, anyway.  Are you all right?~
@929  = ~Hungry, aching, and in bad need of a shoulder to sleep on.  But then I look at Nella's hair and understand it could be much, *much* worse.~
@930  = ~Teri, you are insufferable, do you know that?~
@931  = ~Oh, she does, and very well.  There is nothing wrong with your hair, as it were.  Our lady rogue likes mischief.~
@932  = ~And me!~
@933  = ~And you.  Especially if you sit still for a few hours and let me have my beauty sleep.  Ooh, I need a bath.  Do you think there's any water left in those cisterns to the south?~
@934  = ~Teri, that's an *excellent* idea!~
@935  = ~Holvir, we must NOT let them spend all the water.  I want a bath, too.~
@936  = ~Stealing the credit for my grand scheme! I'll never forgive you.~
@937  = ~You'll have my shoulder forever and ever, but I must wash it, first.  Come!  I'll even restrain myself from proposing to rub your back with soap.~
@938  = ~So, this is it.  Is everyone ready?~ [O#HOL086]
@939  = ~I am ready.~
@940  = ~I have been ready from the start.  The bastard will pay.~
@941  = ~I do not know what is waiting for us behind this door.  But I am ready to face it.~
@942  = ~Teri?~
@943  = ~I am with you.~
@944  = ~This is it.  Shall we go in?~
@945  = ~Yes.  Poquelin must pay for his crimes.~
@946  = ~Not yet.  We still have unfinished business to do.~
@947  = ~No more words.  We go.~
@948  = ~May Tyr's spirit be with us.  Onward, my friends!~
@949  = ~Very well, but let us make haste.  The door is open, and Poquelin must not escape.  Not this time.~
@950  = ~Is everyone all right?~ [O#NEL086]
@951  = ~I think - wait - yes, I am here in one piece.  Everyone else?~
@952  = ~Yes, I am fine.~
@953  = ~But Easthaven is not.  Poquelin spoke the truth.~
@954  = ~Then I will shove those words back down his throat.~
@955  = ~If we find him first.  Why wasn't he teleported next to us, anyway?~
@956  = ~The artifact must have shielded him.  But he cannot be far.~
@957  = ~Perhaps he is in this very tower.  It is reaching him that is the problem.~
@958  = ~Someone must know how to get into the temple.  We must find Everard and the others, quickly!~
@959  = ~So?  What are we waiting for?~
@960  = ~Later.  I want to take a look around.~
@961  = ~Let's go.~
@962  = ~At your command.~
@963  = ~Good.  That would be the best way to find them.~
@964  = ~The very place where we started.  So long ago... and yet, mere days ago.~ [O#HOL087]
@965  = ~We've all changed.  It is sad to see this place demolished.  And knowing that Hrothgar and Arundel are dead makes it all the harder.~
@966  = ~You know what?  Let us introduce ourselves again.~
@967  = ~What do you mean, Teri?~
@968  = ~We've been through a lot, haven't we?  We've changed.  Let's tell about it to each other.  Won't it be momentous?~
@969  = ~That's... not a bad idea, somehow.  All right, but on one condition only: I will start again.~
@970  = ~I am Nella.  My parents were travelling merchants, who paid me little attention.  So when Arundel, the Archdruid of Kuldahar, offered them to take care of me and my education, I agreed gladly.  He became my friend and mentor, and the Tree of Kuldahar became a part of me.~
@971  = ~Arundel's loss was the toughest in my life, but it brought me enlightenment.  For years, I, too, thought of becoming a great leader, a legend, a ruler.  I thought so in secret, yet I was sure that one day, I would take Arundel's place, and perhaps, would accomplish even more.~
@972  = ~But I was wrong.  Only through his death did I understand how dear my mentor truly was to me, and how no power in the world could compare to a loving gesture, his voice... his understanding.  My friends helped me to realize this, and I found love and light again.~
@973  = ~My name is Korin.  I used to be one of the most talented mages of Evereska, and one of the most ruthless ones.  Another few years, and perhaps, you would have been fighting me, not Poquelin.  But this was not to be: I suddenly and mysteriously lost my talent and my gift, and, ashamed, fled to Icewind Dale.~
@974  = ~For a few long years, I was not sure which road to follow.  I craved power for too long to simply forget it.  In the end, I threw caution to the winds and went adventuring with a small group of people who quickly became my friends.  We fought together, and I saw things I never thought of before: the true beauty of love and the real depravity of evil.~
@975  = ~My friends and my faith in Hanali Celanil helped me choose.  I suspect that much in my life has been Hanali's doing... but no matter.  I stand firmly on my path, and I am no longer alone.~
@976  = ~I am Teriel Gilethir, but you may call me Teri.  I came to Icewind Dale to find adventure, and I found it.  More than I had bargained for, but I enjoyed it greatly.  I think I've become older, too... just a little.  I'm not a *new* person, but I'm a grown person.  And it matters.~
@977  = ~I think I've proven myself to myself - and to my parents, too, should they ask.  I've taken to adventuring like a fish to water, so that's what I am going to continue doing.  As soon as we finish that bastard off.~
@978  = ~There is one other thing.  I love.~
@979  = ~And... I am sorry.~
@980  = ~Shhh.  It's all right.  Well, it isn't, but nobody'll eat us if we pretend it is, just for a little while.~
@981  = ~There is one other thing.  I love Severn.~
@982  = ~And I love you.~
@983  = ~Well... I am Severn, and I have a feeling the gods really meant something by making me a bard, even though in the past days, I've rarely taken out my flute.  I love singing more than anything, and now I am good with a sword, too, and even the occassional spell.  And the most important thing is that I am no longer afraid.~
@984  = ~Holvir is my name.  When I was twelve, I saw much evil and darkness, as a great fire ravaged Waterdeep.  I was lost, helpless, but Tyr showed me the way, and clerics mended the damage.  I was determined not to let others be caught in the same nightmare, and dedicated myself to the Order.  Shortly after, I became a squire; not long ago, a full paladin.~
@985  = ~Dark memories never left me, so I found healing in nature.  And when Hrothgar summoned me, and I met my companions, I found new strength in friendship.~
@986  = ~Dark memories never left me, so I found healing in nature.  And when Hrothgar summoned me, and I met my companions, I found new strength in friendship... and then, slowly - in love.  My feelings grew stronger with each day, until I understood that I was ready to guard her sleep for the endless hours, just to see her smile in the morning... and I needed nothing else.~
@987  = ~It pains me to think of goodbyes, but one day, the Order will call me, and words will have to be said.  But you will have my heart, always.~
@988  = ~Your turn.~
@989  = ~I am <CHARNAME>, a traveller and an adventurer.  There is much I could tell you about myself, but I will say only one thing: I found love on this journey.~
@990  = ~I am <CHARNAME>, an adventurer and a fighter for what is good and right.  I am proud to call each of you my friend, and honored to have met you all.~
@991  = ~My name is <CHARNAME>.  I have grown up, too, in these recent days.  When Poquelin is dead, I will have much to think about.~
@992  = ~I am <CHARNAME>, and I haven't changed at all.  I am still the same person who set out from Easthaven with you, only a little more experienced.~
@993  = ~I'd rather not say anything.~
@994  = ~Then it shall be so.~
@995  = ~You have been a great leader to us.  A leader and a comrade.~
@996  = ~Let us stand here for a while.  I would like to remember this moment.~
@997  = ~It is yours forever, my lady.~
@998  = ~And I found you.~
@999  = ~You mean me, don't you.  Thank you, <CHARNAME>.  It means a lot to me, too.~
@1000 = ~Pfft!  You found *me*!~
@1001 = ~But, you know, I think I love you, too.~
@1002 = ~I've been afraid of so many things: darkness, underground, undead, snakes...  Pain.  Death.~ [O#SEV089]
@1003 = ~Severn?  We may not survive it, may we?~ [O#TER091]
@1004 = ~Don't think about it.~ [O#SEV090]
@1005 = ~I just... feel guilty.  You know why.  And I don't want to go on feeling guilty, or to die feeling ashamed.~
@1006 = ~You shouldn't be, not now when you know your heart.  And, Teri... I wish you happiness.  It is hard for me, but I want to see you happy, more than everything else in the world.~
@1007 = ~Thank you.  Thank you, Severn.~
@1008 = ~When it's over, I'll find you the biggest bed in the Dale.~
@1009 = ~Sounds... tantalizing.  And you'll be somewhere near, I take it?~
@1010 = ~Count on it.~
@1011 = ~I'd like us to continue together.  All of us.  I can't imagine how we'd go separate ways.~
@1012 = ~Then we won't.  But my main concern is not going one particular way: the one you'd call "Aaargh!" way.~
@1013 = ~Heh.  I hope not!~
@1014 = ~Come.  Let's show this Poquelin!  We'll make it hot for him.~
@1015 = ~So we shall!~
@1016 = ~Here we are.  The end of everything.~ [O#SEV091]
@1017 = ~Or another seven floors.~
@1018 = ~No, we are at the top.  There is only one way: through the mirror.  If anything happens to us... well... this is our last chance to say goodbye.~
@1019 = ~Supposing we beat this guy, what is to happen to us next?~
@1020 = ~Adventuring without end, of course.  That, and we should help rebuild Easthaven... I think.  What else?~
@1021 = ~No, seriously.  What if we try to imagine our own future?  I could try yours, and so on.~
@1022 = ~Ha!  Good idea, but no chance!  Instead, I will start, and I will start with yours.~
@1023 = ~We will become unseparable, of course.  We'll plunge into every risky, dangerous, noble or profitable venture, sometimes all these together.  Sometimes we'll travel with the others, but often not, and when we do, I am sure they'll have to save our necks from the noose at least once.~
@1024 = ~We may go separate ways for a time.  You will want to, I think.  But we will meet again, and when we do, I may not recognize you at first, so grand your status will become.  You have a bright future ahead of you.~
@1025 = ~I knew I could count on you, Teri.  Well, now.  Korin!~
@1026 = ~You will become a diplomat and a bladesinger, a pride of your city.  With time, your gift may return to you, though you will still be hearing the call of the wilderness.  But this will happen in the centuries to come.  As for now, you will keep adventuring for years, perhaps for decades: it's hard to tell.  You have found love, and it will always be with you, even in the darkest moments.~
@1027 = ~That's too generous.  Nella is the next, then.~
@1028 = ~Our fates are bound together still, and whatever happens, I do not see you alone.  Many perils lie ahead, but much joy, as well.  And even though some of our future adventures will overshadow this one, you will always look back at it with fondness, just as you will never forget your old friends.  Travellers will pass through Kuldahar and the Dale years and centuries later and ask of you, and every servant of nature will speak your name with reverence.~
@1029 = ~Do you remember our first conversation at the temple of Tempus?  You will be remembered.~
@1030 = ~I am not worthy... oh, by the Great Oak, why can't I?  Holvir!~
@1031 = ~Lady Nella?~
@1032 = ~You face a very tough choice ahead.  Between your love for a woman and your love for your Church, you will be torn, though you will not show it openly.  But your pain will be replaced by utmost joy, and your destiny will shine the brightest.~
@1033 = ~This is... ominous.~
@1034 = ~But things will turn out all right for both of you in the end.~
@1035 = ~Who knows...  You may become a king, and a king needs his queen.~
@1036 = ~You will keep providing unshakeable support to our little company.  With years, you will attain a high position in the Order, though I cannot see you behind a desk for many, many years yet.  No, you will continue opposing evil tirelessly, just like you do now.  And eventually, you will learn to let go of your pain.  You will be happy.~
@1037 = ~Thank... thank you.~
@1038 = ~Now... Teri?~
@1039 = ~Don't.  Please, don't.~
@1040 = ~I thought you wanted to know your future?~
@1041 = ~I do, but... I am afraid.  I don't know why; I just am.  Even though I know my future is mine alone, and I have the power to change it.~
@1042 = ~Then these will be my words to you: your future is yours.  Make it a good future.~
@1043 = ~Will anyone care to tell me my future?~
@1044 = ~Thank you, everyone.  We go.~
@1045 = ~Are you ready?  It's never too late to turn back, for either of you.~
@1046 = ~You already know it.  Your destiny is to win.  The rest is your choice.~
@1047 = ~We go.~
@1048 = ~(Holvir takes a deep breath, suddenly leans in and kisses you on the lips, briefly and fiercely.)~
@1049 = ~(Korin takes your hand, ready to step into the mirror.  He looks into your eyes and mouths "I love you.")~
@1050 = ~(Nella throws her arms around your neck, her forehead on your chin.  You stand like this for a long while, then she slowly lets go.)~
@1051 = ~(Teri kisses you full on the mouth, steps back and winks.)~
@1052 = ~After so long, I still know very little of who I am, and what I want.  But there is one thing I am sure of.~ [O#KOR085]
@1053 = ~We have to talk.  Urgently.  This cannot wait.~ [O#TER092]
@1054 = ~This may not be the best time, but...~ [O#HOL088]
@1055 = ~Before we were so rudely interrupted...~ [O#KOR086]
@1056 = ~My friend, a moment alone.~ [O#NEL087]
@1057 = ~Pah!  He ran!  Turned tail and ran!~ [O#TER093]
@1058 = ~When I told you of my feelings, I never imagined you would accept what I had to offer.~ [O#HOL089]
@1059 = ~It is so quiet here.  Poquelin seems to be a long way away.~ [O#KOR087]
@1060 = ~Look through the crystal.  The land is wounded and ravaged.  But it will heal.~ [O#NEL088]
@1061 = ~Looks like it is our last chance to rest properly.~ [O#TER094]
@1062 = ~Should you need assistance, advice or anything else, just ask.~
@1063 = ~Holvir, if you want to lead our party, I entrust the group to you.  Please!  Go ahead.~
@1064 = ~Thank you, Holvir.  Your advice will be most helpful.~
@1065 = ~I will manage, I am sure.~
@1066 = ~You seem ill at ease.  What bothers you?~
@1067 = ~This I will not do.  At this time, in this place, it will feel like a betrayal of Hrothgar's memory.~
@1068 = ~Thank you for your trust.  I shall do my utmost to prove myself worthy of it.~
@1069 = ~As you wish, of course.~
@1070 = ~Forgive me if I seem out of sorts.  Hrothgar's death was too terrible, too unexpected.  Not only was it a severe blow for us, but for the good folk of Easthaven and Kuldahar, and for our expedition, first and foremost.~
@1071 = ~Let us hope that our skills and dedication will be sufficient.  We owe it to Hrothgar and all the others who lost their lives in Kuldahar Pass.~
@1072 = ~You may think so, but I nearly lost an eye downstairs.  Watch your back.~
@1073 = ~I do.  Something... alien.~
@1074 = ~I sense a presence here, an evil presence that is not hostile.  It seems like it is our ally... but it cannot be?~
@1075 = ~Maybe he is a prisoner?~
@1076 = ~If it is not hostile, why does it keep sending skeletons at us?~
@1077 = ~Well, let me know if you sense something else.~
@1078 = ~I cannot tell, but undead view these things differently.  Liches spend hundreds of years in their crypts and do not feel confined.~
@1079 = ~Because we are intruders in his tomb?  Believe it or not, this seems the most likely idea to me.~
@1080 = ~Certainly, though I cannot promise anything.~
@1081 = ~Oh, and one more thing.  This... presence... is more powerful than we all put together.  Be wary.~
@1082 = ~I am sorry, I was thinking aloud.  A great responsibility lies on our shoulders, and I am worried.  We are losing, and the threat to Kuldahar does not diminish.~
@1083 = ~I worry, too.~
@1084 = ~We will be vigilant.~
@1085 = ~Holvir, look at me.  I, <CHARNAME>, the leader of this party, will make sure it turns out all right.  Trust me.~
@1086 = ~Holvir, we do not have time for this.~
@1087 = ~As we should, but it may not be enough.~
@1088 = ~I trust your skills.  Perhaps my concerns are misplaced, but the situation is grave, nevertheless.~
@1089 = ~I am proud of our accomplishments.  We have come a way already, and we should not give up now.  I want you to know that I stand by your side and support you, as I have faith we will find the ones behind this in the end.~
@1090 = ~But we must make haste, because people are continuing to disappear, and the roots of the Tree lie frozen.  Even if we can not prevent the immediate danger, we must give them hope.~
@1091 = ~Hope is the greatest of treasures.  But even I do not possess it in abundance.~
@1092 = ~Thank you for summarizing our goals, but I already know all this.~
@1093 = ~I am grateful for your support.~
@1094 = ~Oh dear, here he goes again...~
@1095 = ~Then let us make haste!~
@1096 = ~You possess courage, my friend.  This is more than enough.~
@1097 = ~Lead us, then.  To Kuldahar.~
@1098 = ~As I am grateful for your council and company.~
@1099 = ~Arundel will know what to do.  One thing is certain: we must not come too late again.~
@1100 = ~You may have never heard about it, but a great fire ravaged Waterdeep some fifteen years ago.  There was no invading army, no battle, but to a small boy it seemed as if the city was being torn apart.  Marauders, screaming in the streets, looting in the gutter, and the guards running and galloping about, only bringing more mayhem to the table.~
@1101 = ~It was deep winter, but the air was hot.  Too hot.  From that day, I could never stand the heat well.~
@1102 = ~How did it end?~
@1103 = ~Why were you alone?  Where were your parents?~
@1104 = ~You were lucky you survived.~
@1105 = ~I am sorry to hear it.~
@1106 = ~But many did not, and it eats at me.~
@1107 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1108 = ~By an unlucky chance, I was alone on that day: my mother sent me with an errand to another part of the city.  I recall it so well, now.  I had to deliver the letter straight to Cecilia Gahar.  Who was she?  Did she survive in the flaming hells?  I have no idea.~
@1109 = ~By the time I got there, the air was heavy with smoke.  I decided to turn back, but the fire cut me off from the familiar streets.  I tried to return, but by then, I could no longer move forward: the streets were crowded; panic burst out.~
@1110 = ~I thought I'd never see my parents again.~
@1111 = ~Well, did you?~
@1112 = ~Did they die?~
@1113 = ~Go on.~
@1114 = ~I am impressed.  You never told me so much of your past before.~
@1115 = ~I was reluctant at first, but it is a part of me.  We rely on each other in battle; each time you keep watch, I entrust my life to you.  We should tell each other these things.~
@1116 = ~For two days, I tried to survive, thinking my family dead.  I was only twelve, but in those hours, I saw things no grown man or woman should ever see.~
@1117 = ~I broke my left arm, trying to stop at least half of these things, and it could have ended then and there, but then the smoke cleared, and people started to come to their senses.~
@1118 = ~My parents were there.  I do not remember how I found them, but I recall taking my father's arm and not letting go for hours, long after my fingers went numb.~
@1119 = ~I did not cry for vengeance, but I longed for these things to stop.  This is how I found Tyr.  Later, the Order found me, and I became a squire.  But nothing has ever hit me as hard as that night in the burning city.~
@1120 = ~What made you relive these events right now?~
@1121 = ~We just killed the Lizard King and freed the prisoners.  Did their plight remind you of yours?~
@1122 = ~Thank you for telling me this.~
@1123 = ~Quite a story.  Shall we go now?~
@1124 = ~We killed the lizards and freed the villagers, but for me, it was no ordinary good deed.  In my heart, I feel I am still repaying the debt to a young boy who lost his innocence in Waterdeep fifteen years ago.~
@1125 = ~I hope that one day, I will sit by the fire reflecting on the warmth and comfort, not on my memories.  Perhaps I made the first step today.~
@1126 = ~Of course.  Thank you for hearing me out.~
@1127 = ~A race that feeds on betrayal and lies is shocking.  It is its own worst enemy, but before it falls, it will spread unbelievable hatred and strife.~
@1128 = ~Tyr teaches that every life is sacred, until it starts to tread on and consume the lives of others.  Then justice must be served.  I deal the blows without hesitation: it is a task that must be done.  Yet I am uneasy.~
@1129 = ~It's them or us, I say.  There is no room for hesitation in battle.~
@1130 = ~What about mercy?  Will you show it?~
@1131 = ~Some races deserve death.  Killing them is a right thing to do.~
@1132 = ~If you continue like this, you may become a killing machine.~
@1133 = ~This is not right.  There are exceptions for every race.~
@1134 = ~I shall, and I have.~
@1135 = ~If I do, I shall cease to be a paladin of Tyr.~
@1136 = ~I am sorry, I do not know why I started this discussion.  Perhaps... sometimes I have doubts.~
@1137 = ~Every sentient creature is inherently good, there can be no other way.  Why, then, do I see goblin after goblin, Yuan-ti after Yuan-ti, and see only death and darkness in their eyes?  Even their children fight and kill: kobold offspring slaughter human children and animals, and orcs are worse.~
@1138 = ~I have no answer.  Do you?~
@1139 = ~No, I do not know, either.~
@1140 = ~It may change some day.~
@1141 = ~Some races are inherently good, some - inherently evil.~
@1142 = ~They are viewing us as evil.~
@1143 = ~Who can say what is good and what is evil?~
@1144 = ~It may be our only hope.~
@1145 = ~I can.  You can.~
@1146 = ~The concept of good and evil is universal, evident to every creature, impossible to hide, unless you will yourself blind.  I know it, I feel it.  Different as we are, it is embedded into every heart.  Yet some resist it so strongly... why?~
@1147 = ~I understand them.  We are different, Holvir, and we want to be different.~
@1148 = ~They may never see the light.  But we do, and it is important not to lose it, but to keep fighting.~
@1149 = ~Well, I am not a "good person", and I am proud of it!~
@1150 = ~No, <CHARNAME>.  You are a good person, despite any claims to the contrary.  Caring and taking pains to deny it only makes you more humane.~
@1151 = ~Only then can we hope to win.  True words, <CHARNAME>.~
@1152 = ~Have we come in vain, then?  But then we have no one to ask: Arundel lies dead, so Severed Hand is our only hope.~
@1153 = ~Yet Arundel sent us here.  What did he know that we do not?~
@1154 = ~That someone or something else may help us here?~
@1155 = ~That it is possible to bring Larrel back to sanity?~
@1156 = ~I do not know.~
@1157 = ~Holvir, we do not have time for this.  Come inside.~
@1158 = ~Possibly.  This elven fortress holds many secrets.~
@1159 = ~I can only imagine how hard these losses must have been on you, our leader.  First Hrothgar, then the others... finally, Arundel.  Great warriors, good men, faithful soldiers.  You know this already, but allow me to say it again: these losses are  not in any way your fault.  Tyr sees, we all did our best.~
@1160 = ~I often think of sacrifice.  Arundel's last act of sacrifice was valiant, and his decision to remain in Kuldahar, knowing how dangerous it had to be, was the bravest thing of which I've ever heard.  Remaining in the path of evil and giving up one's life so willingly - I salute him.~
@1161 = ~I think of his deeds, and I think of myself.  I am a knight of Tyr, and my path, too, expects sacrifice of me.  What of you?~
@1162 = ~I can say the same about myself.  I am ready.~
@1163 = ~I admire Arundel's resolve, but I do not know if I have his strength.~
@1164 = ~No.  I may be a coward, but I want to live.~
@1165 = ~Of course not!  Are you taking me for a fool?~
@1166 = ~If willingness alone measures it, then I say I am ready.  But it remains to be seen if either of us has the courage.~
@1167 = ~Strength is often found in unexpected places.  I think you already have it.~
@1168 = ~Then it will be up to you to rebuild and create anew, after all who have sacrificed themselves are gone, and the fire and the storm have raged and ceased.  It takes a different kind of courage.~
@1169 = ~You deny it so vehemently that I wonder if you are telling the whole truth.  Perhaps... but no.~
@1170 = ~Perhaps I should not have asked you: it was a very personal question, after all.  But I feel that we are more than mere travelling companions.  Over time and much fighting and loss, we are slowly becoming friends.  And true friendship is precious.~
@1171 = ~I would like to spend some time in these rooms.  With you, if I may.~
@1172 = ~With me?  Why?~
@1173 = ~So would I.  We can learn and discover much here.~
@1174 = ~It sounds really romantic.~
@1175 = ~Of course.~
@1176 = ~I would rather not.  We must hurry.~
@1177 = ~True; but I should explain myself better.~
@1178 = ~Because I enjoy your company, and value your judgement.~
@1179 = ~In the Order, I spent many hours in training.  Yet I spent even more in the library, pouring over accounts and recordings, both new and old.~
@1180 = ~Not to escape; do not misunderstand me.  I love this world, and I never tire of feasting my eyes on it, of learning more about it, of striving to make it better in any way I can.  I wondered if this was the case with you.~
@1181 = ~It is.  But often, I want to escape this world, and to explore new ones.~
@1182 = ~I could not have put it better myself.~
@1183 = ~I like reading, but not for the purposes you describe.~
@1184 = ~Not really.  I prefer action to contemplation.~
@1185 = ~I am not especially fond of reading.~
@1186 = ~Holvir, we REALLY don't have time for this.~
@1187 = ~There is much to see in this world.  And much to do.  But it often seems to me that other worlds are but an extension of this one: you will escape and make a full circle.~
@1188 = ~Then you look at what really is there.~
@1189 = ~During that fateful day in Waterdeep, I saw many things destroyed by the fire, but never a book.  Never a sight of burning pages.  Books, it would seem, are more precious sometimes than the lives of men.  Or perhaps I had not seen them burn, since the denizens of the poorer part of the city did not have any.~
@1190 = ~How many wonderful tomes does this library contain?  Or conceal, since not a living soul will read them.  If only we had time.~
@1191 = ~If only.~
@1192 = ~We will take the most important tomes with us.~
@1193 = ~But we don't.  Saving people matters more than saving books.~
@1194 = ~You are right, of course.  With your leave, I will take a few tomes, and we shall be on our way.~
@1195 = ~I like reading in my spare time.  But the clouds are gathering, and soon we shall have none.  For now, it is the calm before the storm.~
@1196 = ~Although this storm has brought us together.  If not for all these deaths and darkness, I should be grateful.~
@1197 = ~Before we spoke of good and evil in the hearts of men.  If these men are steadfast and loyal to what is good, and if these men survive, unlike this poor fellow, they become heroes in their own right.  Or do they?  What do you think makes a hero, <CHARNAME>?~
@1198 = ~Courage and sacrifice.~
@1199 = ~Accepting the call to adventure and doing great things that are good and noble.~
@1200 = ~Doing the dirty job for the so-called community.~
@1201 = ~Well-invested money and a well-thought campaign.~
@1202 = ~I do not think in these terms.  But you are a hero.~
@1203 = ~Let us talk another time.~
@1204 = ~This is the heart of it, I would say.~
@1205 = ~<CHARNAME>, you are insufferable.  But your good-natured cynicism has its charm.~
@1206 = ~Flatterer.  Then so are you.~
@1207 = ~You know that you are a hero, don't you?  Even if you try to deny it: out of modesty, out of spite, or because of your views.~
@1208 = ~Above all, a hero performs deeds others call heroic, which is what you have done.  You were determined to save Kuldahar, and you are still on that path.~
@1209 = ~Yes, but like I said, I am only in it for money.~
@1210 = ~I am not trying to deny it.  I take pride in my deeds.~
@1211 = ~You flatter me.~
@1212 = ~But I am also capable of far darker deeds.  Am I still a hero?~
@1213 = ~Your reasons are your own, but I am afraid that bards will not take them into account.~
@1214 = ~And well you should.  It is an honor to fight at your side.~
@1215 = ~No, you flatter yourself.  You deserve praise, <CHARNAME>; receive it.~
@1216 = ~You may be capable of darker deeds, but have done none such here, and none now. Here and now, you are indeed a hero.~
@1217 = ~But I should not distract you like this.  Just know that I am proud of the way we have come together.~
@1218 = ~Ah.  I deserved this answer, I suppose.~
@1219 = ~Now that you are wearing the mantle of leadership so well, I would like to tell you something I was hesitant to share with you before.~
@1220 = ~A paladin must not show weakness.  Not in the face of the enemy, and not in the face of his companions.  A paladin will remind his companions of their achievements, and of the task at hand, even if he sounds pompous.  He will not tell lies, but he will give praise where he can.  Does this sound boring to you?~
@1221 = ~No, not at all.  Go on.~
@1222 = ~A little.~
@1223 = ~I do not understand where you are leading to.~
@1224 = ~It is a very accurate summary of your conduct.~
@1225 = ~Just as any man, I am flawed.  I feel pain, fear, loss; sometimes I am cold and afraid.  But I am a paladin.  I have to be a rock, even if it does not portray me in the most favorable light.~
@1226 = ~And you are telling me this now... why?~
@1227 = ~You make a great rock, too.~
@1228 = ~I understand.~
@1229 = ~Because you are my friend.  Come, we still have much to do.~
@1230 = ~Thank you.  Come, we still have much to do.~
@1231 = ~It is a good sign.  It looks like even the weather gives us some breathing space.~
@1232 = ~You are tired, aren't you?~
@1233 = ~Yes, it's been hard.  Battle after battle after battle.~
@1234 = ~Tell you what.  Why don't we escape to Kuldahar for a short while?  Walk around the Tree, visit the shops, spend some time in the tavern?~
@1235 = ~A good idea, even if only to check that the inhabitants are all right.  But it is a long march.~
@1236 = ~When I think of my life through the past few years, I notice I never needed an extended rest.  Rest from what?  For what?  But I live for these moments, when the sky becomes one with the snow-covered road.  Then I rest, even as my legs keep walking.~
@1237 = ~And it helps me forget.~
@1238 = ~Forget what?~
@1239 = ~You still dwell on that fire, don't you?~
@1240 = ~Forget fallen friends, slain enemies, or something else?~
@1241 = ~I think of that fire often, more often than I should.  It was a starting point of my journey, to make this world better, and it is still a beacon I often return to.~
@1242 = ~You see, a paladin cannot live with anger and hate forever.  I cannot.  But dwelling on the injustice for too long inevitably leads to anger or detachment, there is no other way.~
@1243 = ~So I choose another road.  I instead dwell on beauty, on good deeds and steadfast friends.  I do not often indulge in these simple pleasures: there is always a task ahead.  But when I do, it is bliss.~
@1244 = ~The snow, the air, and the waning moon far on the horizon.  What else to wish for?~
@1245 = ~(Holvir slowly, tenderly takes your hand and brings it to his lips.)~
@1246 = ~Only for your company.~
@1247 = ~To me it means even more responsibility.  What shall I do with this strength, this... power?  What would you do?~
@1248 = ~You forget that I have more freedom in my choices than you do.~
@1249 = ~You have a patron, you serve the holy Order.  Surely they will tell you what to do?~
@1250 = ~I would exercise  this power to protect the weak and to do good, just like we do now.~
@1251 = ~I may well abuse this power.~
@1252 = ~Untrue, <CHARNAME>.  Every man is born free.  There is always a choice.~
@1253 = ~This is not the case. Some choices I must make myself.~
@1254 = ~Oh, yes.  You've ever been showing me the path through your own example.  We learn from each other.~
@1255 = ~It is an easy trap to fall into, I agree.  Almost too easy.~
@1256 = ~I am not asking you whether I should continue to serve the Order.  If I wanted to leave Tyr, I'd have done that long ago.  I am not only bound by duty: I honestly wish to serve.  I cannot fathom how it could be otherwise.~
@1257 = ~But my path takes many directions.  I may return to Waterdeep, find a new temple here, or continue travelling.  My superiors are not unreasonable: as long as I continue on the path of right, they will honor my choice.~
@1258 = ~We are close to our enemy's lair.  Too close, I can feel it.  It may soon be the time to decide.~
@1259 = ~If we survive.~
@1260 = ~More than once, you've told us to listen to our hearts, and now I would like to return the advice.  Listen to yours.~
@1261 = ~I would like you to continue travelling with me.~
@1262 = ~You may have to return to Waterdeep, first.~
@1263 = ~Yes, and we will.  Good must triumph over evil, always.~
@1264 = ~So would I, at least for a time.  We cannot know what will happen, but I shall be happy if our road takes us together.~
@1265 = ~I will certainly visit Waterdeep eventually; I would like to visit the Order and my parents.  But for the time being, and perhaps for a few years hence, I see myself by your side.~
@1266 = ~Your road is yours.  But this journey... it has been both a pleasure and an honor.~
@1267 = ~And perhaps more than that.~
@1268 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you see this?  Something is controlling these priests.  In the name of Tyr... it emanates hatred as we speak.  We must stop it!~
@1269 = ~Wait, what is it?~
@1270 = ~I do not know, but we must hurry.  I feel as if my worst memories are running through my brain.  Stay here a while longer, and you will start to lose your mind.  I would rather protect you from that.~
@1271 = ~Thank you, but I will manage myself.~
@1272 = ~What do you see?~
@1273 = ~I know, but I must do my duty.  You are our leader, and your sanity is worth more than mine.~
@1274 = ~I see Waterdeep, but this time it is I who is setting fire to it.  And... doing other unspeakable things.  I do not want to watch.~
@1275 = ~Come, <CHARNAME>.  We must stop it.  I am scared for you, and I am scared for myself.~
@1276 = ~I am scared for you, too.  You matter very much to me, Holvir.~
@1277 = ~Let us do what we must.~
@1278 = ~(Holvir starts at first, then kisses you on the cheek.)~
@1279 = ~I know.~
@1280 = ~<CHARNAME>, come aside with me, please.~
@1281 = ~Very well.  What is it?~
@1282 = ~I am listening.~
@1283 = ~I would rather not.~
@1284 = ~Even if it is very important to me?~
@1285 = ~I think I know what it is, and... no.~
@1286 = ~All right, I will come with you.~
@1287 = ~Even then.~
@1288 = ~Then I will not disturb you further.~
@1289 = ~I wanted to avoid this conversation at all costs, but it is unfair to hide it from you.  You deserve the truth.~
@1290 = ~What truth?~
@1291 = ~You love me.~
@1292 = ~Continue...~
@1293 = ~I have... strong feelings for you.  Now you know.~
@1294 = ~And I have feelings for you.~
@1295 = ~What are we going to do about it?~
@1296 = ~But I cannot respond in kind.~
@1297 = ~But you serve Tyr; you said before you will never marry.~
@1298 = ~That is correct.  Worse, it is my firm belief that it should be so.~
@1299 = ~I love you, and I would never leave you, should the choice be mine alone.  And it *is* mine, as well as yours: while you remain on the most righteous path, as you do now, the Order would welcome our association.~
@1300 = ~But my life lies on the road, and will continue to do so for many years ahead.  I cannot start a family in any form.  Do you understand what it means?~
@1301 = ~It means that we must part.~
@1302 = ~It means chastity.~
@1303 = ~Then I will travel with you, by your side.~
@1304 = ~I could stay at home with children, and welcome you after your journeys.~
@1305 = ~We will travel together.  Should there be children, they will stay at home, and we will visit them.~
@1306 = ~If that is your wish - yes.  It would be wise and reasonable.~
@1307 = ~Yes, indeed.  Chastity and fidelity.~
@1308 = ~I would that it would be so.  But perhaps you do not understand, yet.~
@1309 = ~This cannot come to be, <CHARNAME>.~
@1310 = ~There can be no full physical closeness between us.  I do not think that you want that... which is why I thought it would be best if you did not know of my feelings.  But then I saw your knowing look more than once.  You knew, didn't you?~
@1311 = ~I did, but I did not want to embarrass you.~
@1312 = ~No, it came as a complete surprise.~
@1313 = ~But we can take precautions.  Sharing a bed does not mean starting a family.~
@1314 = ~So, this is all you can give me?  Innocent love?~
@1315 = ~It may.~
@1316 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but this is how things are.~
@1317 = ~Then I cannot accept it.~
@1318 = ~And I love you anyway.~
@1319 = ~I will remain with you.~
@1320 = ~And I would have them no other way.~
@1321 = ~You will always have my friendship, and my heart.  No matter what comes.~
@1322 = ~Travelling as comrades rather than lovers, never settling down, never pledging ourselves fully to each other - is this what you want, <CHARNAME>?  Is this your future?~
@1323 = ~I want to be by your side.  I do not care about other things.~
@1324 = ~Yes, this is what I want.  This is my future.~
@1325 = ~I do not know, but I do not want us to part just yet.~
@1326 = ~Who knows, perhaps in a few years, something will make you change your mind, or your lifestyle.~
@1327 = ~Perhaps it is not.  But it is my present.~
@1328 = ~I need no pledge.  You will never stop loving me; I just know.~
@1329 = ~You may change your mind, and realize you care.~
@1330 = ~Tyr sees that I am weak: I feared and hoped for this answer.~
@1331 = ~Even so, your choice honors me.  Yet...~
@1332 = ~A crippling strike may do that, but would you wish such a fate on me?~
@1333 = ~I will never stop loving you.  But now, when the time for the final battle is nigh, is the best moment to let go of hasty promises.  I do not want to hold you to anything: I just want you to be happy.  Your image will be with me always, wherever you go.  But your life is yours to live.~
@1334 = ~And I will live it with you.  Simple, isn't it?~
@1335 = ~We will blaze this trail together.~
@1336 = ~Perhaps we will part very soon; perhaps I will find another love.  But this does not change that here and now, I love you.~
@1337 = ~We are bound by many other things.  Duty, desire to do good, and above all, friendship.  You will not get rid of me so easily.~
@1338 = ~We will forge a great future.~
@1339 = ~Blessed be this day and place.  It will become my new touchstone in the years to come.~
@1340 = ~Nor would I wish to.~
@1341 = ~A part of me does not want to leave.~
@1342 = ~I understand.  It is very peaceful here.~
@1343 = ~Where do you live, Korin?~
@1344 = ~But you were not born in these parts, right?~
@1345 = ~You do not have to.~
@1346 = ~Up on the mountain slope, in a small wooden house.  There is always a hot mug of tea for an unexpected guest... but no longer.~
@1347 = ~Of course not.  I was born in the elven lands, but five years ago, circumstances forced me to move north.~
@1348 = ~No, no, I am not an escaped criminal or anything of the kind.  Since we are travelling together, I should tell you the whole story, and I will.  But not here.~
@1349 = ~I have decided.  All the same, I shall be sorry to leave Easthaven behind.~
@1350 = ~If you look upwards, you will not see my house - only tall black firs.  But it is there.  Every morning, I used to walk barefoot to the forest spring, to sit in the snow and watch the water.~
@1351 = ~It is very quiet.  Sometimes I hear distant barking, or far away echoes.  It is difficult to believe I may not return: this life seems so solid, unchangeable...  I do not know if I should tell you this, but I am not wholly sure there are things more precious than the quiet times I enjoyed.~
@1352 = ~It sounds selfish, but I understand.  It must have been wonderful.~
@1353 = ~Wasn't it boring?~
@1354 = ~Is this a ranger speaking?  The one who swore to protect the good folk of this village?~
@1355 = ~Boring?  I have never been bored in my entire life.  Anxious, chagrined, angry, ecstatic, abashed, murderous - yes.  Bored?  No.  I know of the feeling, but not the feeling.~
@1356 = ~Hrothgar never asked me for a pledge of any kind.  What little help I could give was provided out of gratitude, not of obligation.  My stay in Easthaven was temporary; he knew that.~
@1357 = ~Lives of other men are more important than any selfish whim of mine, I know.  But it is not what I am thinking - this is what I *should* be thinking.  Goodness does not come naturally to me.~
@1358 = ~Ahem.  I am sorry for unburdening myself in such an unbecoming manner, and probably confusing you, too.  I just wanted you to know that I have little experience at being a ranger, and even less at being an adventurer.  And as for doing the right thing - I intend to, but it is not my heartfelt desire as of yet.~
@1359 = ~Then we will learn together.~
@1360 = ~Each man has an intrinsic concept of good.  Just listen to your heart.~
@1361 = ~Welcome to my party, Korin.~
@1362 = ~I hope so.  Every journey holds an element of self-discovery, doesn't it?~
@1363 = ~That's what they say, and, truth be told, it annoys me.  Those who follow their hearts do so without external guiding, those who cannot hardly need help from without.  But thank you nevertheless.~
@1364 = ~I am still unsure if I am doing the right thing, but I must, now, or I may never tell you at all.  So, please, do not interrupt me.~
@1365 = ~I know it must be difficult to believe, but I once hoped to become a mage.  It was the dearest ambition of my life, and the Seldarine themselves seemed in agreement.~
@1366 = ~I was one of the best students in the Academy of Magic in Evereska, and by the best I mean unrivalled.  Older and wiser mages had more power, but not a single one had more ability than I.~
@1367 = ~You sound bitter.~
@1368 = ~You were very modest, too, I see.~
@1369 = ~What happened?  You are obviously not a mage any more.~
@1370 = ~Do I?  It is fitting: that was my life.  Nothing is left of it now; I might as well be talking of a dead man.~
@1371 = ~I do not lie, <CHARNAME>: that was my life.  Nothing is left of it now; I might as well be talking of a dead man.~
@1372 = ~I was sure I was destined to become one of the greatest mages in our history.  I did not want power: I had it.  I did not want acknowledgement, or lording over others - their opinions just did not matter.  No, this is not precisely true.  I wanted changes, but I was biding my time, until one fateful day...~
@1373 = ~You will be disappointed with the ending: it was too abrupt even for me.  I was walking to the library, and at some point, something - no, everything -  felt wrong.  I was alive and well, I was conscious of the Weave, but the core of my spellcraft has gone.  Irreversibly, as it turned out later.~
@1374 = ~What did you do?~
@1375 = ~Couldn't anyone in the Academy help?~
@1376 = ~But why did you leave elven lands?~
@1377 = ~How?  What could they do, <CHARNAME>, petition the gods?  It was gone.~
@1378 = ~Remember, <CHARNAME>, I was one of the best mages in my generation.  I conducted myself in accordance to this fact: haughty does not express half of it.  I could not reveal this shame, to be laughed at, to be pitied!  Not I.~
@1379 = ~I kept walking.  I reached the library, opened a book at random, and in half an hour, I had a plan.  I returned home, took some coin, a warm cloak, a walking stick and some water, and was gone at dusk.~
@1380 = ~Two months later, I arrived at Icewind Dale.  I heard Easthaven was an especially quiet place, and decided to settle there.  Hrothgar allowed me to use a small hut in the mountains, and I helped him to track bandits and ward off goblins in return.  I never looked back.~
@1381 = ~Don't you miss home?  Friends, parents?~
@1382 = ~What do you think happened to you?~
@1383 = ~I am sorry to hear this.~
@1384 = ~Is there any hope for you?~
@1385 = ~They must be thinking I am dead.  At least, this is what I hope they do.~
@1386 = ~I try not to think about it.~
@1387 = ~None that I know of, and I did not ask around much, as you can imagine.~
@1388 = ~I am as aware of the Weave as any elf, but I am numb in the part which involves magic.  Nearly all elves who do not dabble in the Art can say the same, but I had the Art in my blood.  I will always remember.~
@1389 = ~Enough of this.  Thank you for listening.~
@1390 = ~There are many tombs around Evereska, and young mages often visit them with guardians and guides.  It is a bleak, depressing experience, but not even remotely risky.~
@1391 = ~Now we can very possibly be killed.  We are risking our lives underground, to save the lives of others.  Strangely, it is a rewarding thought.~
@1392 = ~I don't know.  I am only in it for money.~
@1393 = ~I feel the same.~
@1394 = ~And one day, the world shall know it!~
@1395 = ~Korin, let us talk another time.~
@1396 = ~Are you now?  Well, a desire for money and luxury is as good a motivation as any.  Perhaps money gives you something I can only dream of.~
@1397 = ~I am not looking forward to this.  Bards are prone to exaggerating, and, between us two, downright lies.~
@1398 = ~Present company excepted, of course.~
@1399 = ~But I'd rather you did not tell Severn that.~
@1400 = ~When I found myself in a small hut near the Spine of the World, I thought that I might take up adventuring some day, but I never thought of the long hours underground.  It is strange, isn't it?  I thought of plains and forests and towns and lakes, but never of caves, crypts or dungeons.~
@1401 = ~I never thought about putting my life at risk for the benefit of others, ever.  Adventuring was just that - wandering the lands, narrowly escaping deadly perils, and becoming all the richer as a result.~
@1402 = ~Now that it is so concrete, I marvel at how different it seems.  Even though death seems much more real, I will not turn back.  It is an entirely different world, and I am starting to enjoy it, in a way.~
@1403 = ~Well done!~
@1404 = ~And now you have friends, too.~
@1405 = ~But you are still afraid of death and uncomfortable underground, aren't you?~
@1406 = ~My greatest gain these days.  My life in the mountains was serene, but at times loneliness gnawed away at me.  Now it does so no longer.~
@1407 = ~So I am; you are astute.  But now, after our conversation, I feel much better. Thank you.~
@1408 = ~I saw him in the inn, in Easthaven.  He did not want to go with us.  He said we might meet later... later...~
@1409 = ~Oh, gods.~
@1410 = ~What was he doing there?~
@1411 = ~He probably decided to help us and failed.~
@1412 = ~I am sorry, too.  He was a good man... elf.~
@1413 = ~I do not remember him at all.  Did we meet him in Easthaven?~
@1414 = ~Korin, I do not want to talk now.~
@1415 = ~What does it matter?  He is dead.~
@1416 = ~All on his own...~
@1417 = ~He must have been.  I never knew him.~
@1418 = ~Yes.  At least, I did, shortly before meeting you in the tavern.~
@1419 = ~I tried to talk to him, but I fled immediately after he said he was from Evereska.  I did not know him, but I did not want to risk it.~
@1420 = ~It is funny, isn't it?  After all these years in self-exile, after months of risking my life, I still cared about my little secret.  Back home, I thought it was dignity.  Now I call it stubbornness.~
@1421 = ~I am sorry, I am rambling - it is a shock.  Are you all right?~
@1422 = ~Oh, yes, I am fine.~
@1423 = ~I am shocked, too.  I did not expect to find his body here.~
@1424 = ~No, I... need some time.~
@1425 = ~Of course. Lean on me, if you want.  There, it should be better.~
@1426 = ~Death.  It can be so sudden... so disheartening.  And the shock is sometimes so strong that I do not know which of my lives has been a dream: my quiet walks along the shores of Lac Dinneshere, or the dead air of these caves, my companions, armed and wary... your frown... a trickle of blood on my wrist...~
@1427 = ~No, this is real.  This is real, Erevain is dead, and I should focus on the task at hand, instead.  Let us get this over with.~
@1428 = ~This mail was wrought to provide protection against the followers of Hanali, our goddess of love, and her human counterpart, Sune.  It contains a powerful enchantment, but I do not think anyone should wear it.~
@1429 = ~Why?  It is not cursed, is it?~
@1430 = ~We need every suit of magical armor, Korin.~
@1431 = ~Whatever you say.~
@1432 = ~Korin, I do not want to discuss this.~
@1433 = ~No, no, it is important that you understand.  Did I mention I was a very ardent follower of Hanali Celanil while still in the elven lands?  No, of course you wouldn't know of that.~
@1434 = ~My devotion to the goddess was very literal then - I did not deem any mortal to be worthy of my love, so if there was one, I thought, it must be her.  Hanali.  Lying naked in the sun with my arms open wide and thinking of her caresses... and I swear, there were moments when they were real.~
@1435 = ~I worship her differently now: perhaps I am disillusioned, or perhaps I have grown up.  She is love itself, a force which is impossible to explain, but which makes every moment of the bleakest life worthwhile.~
@1436 = ~When I think how someone has labored to diminish this force, to tarnish or to destroy her, I shudder.  This suit of armor is not simply an enchanted mail - it is a banner for the new followers of the cause.  Leave it here, <CHARNAME>.  Or take it and sell it, but do not make it *our* banner.~
@1437 = ~You told me much more than I needed to know.  I could live without some of the details.~
@1438 = ~If it is so important for you.~
@1439 = ~I am sorry, Korin, but no.~
@1440 = ~I had to tell you all this, so that you understand.  The choice is yours, but whoever forged this mail wanted to destroy a part of my life, among other things.~
@1441 = ~I am sorry if my words caused you discomfort.  I do not often share my most intimate memories even with friends, but this... thing... provoked a rather strong reaction.  Still, it was a mistake on my part.  Excuse me, please; we will talk later.~
@1442 = ~The Hand of the Seldarine was a majestic elven stronghold.  The key word is "was" - I dread to think of what must be happening there now.  And I would prefer to travel there under different circumstances.  Arundel's death was an unexpected blow.~
@1443 = ~It was.  I will miss him.~
@1444 = ~He was ready for this.~
@1445 = ~We will finish his task for him.  Kuldahar will not be destroyed.~
@1446 = ~Korin, I am in no mood to talk right now.~
@1447 = ~I feel grief, but also a strong temptation.  Look at their fates, <CHARNAME>: Arundel, Hrothgar, Erevain, Jerrod - good men and heroes, all dead.  They labored, they sacrificed, and they will live in memory, but they could have lived among us for many, many years.~
@1448 = ~We talked of the nature of goodness before, and how it does not come easily to some of us.  To me.  If not for the loss of my gift, I could have easily been the one behind the recent attacks.  Uncaring, drunk on power, and as ruthless as any priest of Auril - this was my portrait a few years ago.  Yes, the years spent at the outskirts of Easthaven have mellowed me, but who knows what could have been?~
@1449 = ~Who knows what yet may be...  I want to behold the Hand of the Seldarine, but what if it calls me to power?  Will I be able to resist?~
@1450 = ~Korin, enough of your delusions of grandeur.  What can one ranger do?~
@1451 = ~Yes, you will.  Just as you have been able to resist before.~
@1452 = ~You will.  I believe in you.~
@1453 = ~I will help you, and so will the others.  You are not alone.~
@1454 = ~In an ancient stronghold of his people, armed with word and deed?  Take a guess.~
@1455 = ~You believe in me, but I do not always believe in myself.~
@1456 = ~I'd like to say I worry needlessly, but it is a lie.  I see how pointless the struggle against evil seems sometimes.  I see the scope of the sacrifice, and to the gods, it never seems to be enough.  I grow tired, cold and disappointed, and it eats at me.  Even my faith grows bleak.~
@1457 = ~It is just an aftermath of the shock.  It will pass.~
@1458 = ~I am here for you, and I am always ready to listen.  Remember this before doing something rash.~
@1459 = ~These thoughts visit me, too, but such is our nature.  I am sure Arundel and Hrothgar, too, had doubts.~
@1460 = ~What do you want from me?~
@1461 = ~Oh, I know it will.  The question is, will it be replaced with newly found hope, or with grim certainty?~
@1462 = ~I will.  Thank you, <CHARNAME>.  It matters more than you might think.~
@1463 = ~Their innate goodness was strong; deep in their hearts, they never had any darkness at all.  They were heroes.  My triumph over doubt seems far away.~
@1464 = ~Perhaps the Hand of the Seldarine will have the answers, and not just for me alone.  We all need to find ourselves.~
@1465 = ~I am sorry for taking your time, when the others need it much more - Nella, for one.  But thank you for listening.~
@1466 = ~And to think that I had some delusional designs about coming to this place and seizing the... ohhh, my face burns as I remember.  They honed their skills, fought and bled for the elves, for the Tel'Quessir.  For me.  And if *this* disaster was accidental, how much harm could an archmage bring, if he abused the power knowingly?~
@1467 = ~Indeed.  Let this be a lesson to us all.~
@1468 = ~It would bring an even worse disaster.~
@1469 = ~You are too hard on yourself.  You never even planned anything of the kind!~
@1470 = ~I suppose I am still trying to prove my good intentions to my younger self, who is even no longer there.  And until today, I did not believe I could convince him that I would truly refuse raw power, should it come to me.  Not until I saw the ghostly girl in an empty room, crying for her mother; and the mother, still longing for her child beyond the veil.~
@1471 = ~I spent the years in Easthaven trying to forget, to make peace with myself.  But when we set out to forgotten temples and ancient tombs, I felt my old self stir again.  It took several flights of stairs and Kaylessa's sacrifice to make him see.  Yet he is me.  Do you understand me?~
@1472 = ~Not quite.  Will you explain?~
@1473 = ~Of course.  It is difficult to refuse power, even after seeing what it can do.~
@1474 = ~He is you, and both of you have grown wiser.~
@1475 = ~I do.  Redemption is never easy.~
@1476 = ~No, I've lost you long ago.~
@1477 = ~When I was young and studied the arcane arts in Evereska, I grew heedless and arrogant.  When the magic left me all of a sudden, I spent years in self-exile, and I thought I was a changed man.  I was not bursting with the desire to help my neighbor, but neither did I strive to rule the world, or crush all that would oppose my desires.  I was at peace.~
@1478 = ~Then I set out with your adventuring company, and soon enough, the young man I thought was dead started to wake up.  Korin of Evereska had to choose.~
@1479 = ~And did he?~
@1480 = ~I understand now.~
@1481 = ~And you chose to refuse the temptation.~
@1482 = ~You know my answer.  He did, and his choice was made, but I will have to keep choosing every moment of my life.  As will you; as shall we all.~
@1483 = ~But I have strayed from the original topic, and Kaylessa.  Let us stand here for a few moments, in silence.  They died in the name of the People; their spirits deserve to be honored.~
@1484 = ~Look at the table, the bed, the window - it is all the same.  Do you see the runes on the tapestries?  One of the best inventions in our history: letting young mages study at all times.  These are pieces of arcane knowledge, historical accounts, notes on enchantment and divination.~
@1485 = ~Clever.  I have been using it in my studies, too.~
@1486 = ~And by the end of the year, the acolytes memorized it by heart, I take it?~
@1487 = ~What of it?~
@1488 = ~Korin, we do not have time for this.~
@1489 = ~So we had, but you haven't seen all there is to see.~
@1490 = ~Oh, but you haven't seen all there is to see.~
@1491 = ~Here, sit on the bed next to me, and... no, you will not be comfortable this way.  Just lie down by my side.~
@1492 = ~And take off my clothes?~
@1493 = ~All right...~
@1494 = ~Why, what for?~
@1495 = ~Tempting, but there is too much company... oh, what am I saying?~
@1496 = ~Trust me, I do not mean anything of the, ah, other kind.  Just sit on the bed and look up.~
@1497 = ~The archmages and mentors of old were wise men, and they remembered their school years, and long hours of staring at the ceiling.  So, they adorned it with runes.  Excerpts from holy books and arcane scrolls, Labelas's words - they are all here.~
@1498 = ~Very impressive.~
@1499 = ~There is always room for learning, eh?~
@1500 = ~You must be missing those times.~
@1501 = ~(Take his hand)~
@1502 = ~Ah, a perfect double-entendre.~
@1503 = ~I do miss the years in the Academy greatly, just like I miss the years of peace.  But there are compensations.  Friendship makes up for the downsides, though the sadness and the sacrifice of this place is not easily forgotten.~
@1504 = ~And your company more than makes up for the rest.~
@1505 = ~(His fingers slide into yours.)~
@1506 = ~I miss my former life dearly.  My studies of the Planes, my diaries, my spellbook, my city, my parents and my mentors.  And at the moments of utmost bitterness, like now, I'd have discarded them all for a single moment of oneness with the Weave, for the lazy levitating among the treetops, for the easy ecstasy that is magic.~
@1507 = ~Then again, if I had no legs, I would ache to walk.  I am still happier than many.  Who knows, perhaps one day I shall walk the streets of Evereska again, this time as a mighty ranger and a defender of Kuldahar?~
@1508 = ~You will not be ashamed of the loss of your gift then?~
@1509 = ~You have spoken too soon.  Kuldahar has not been saved, yet.~
@1510 = ~Who knows indeed.~
@1511 = ~Korin, we don't have time for this.~
@1512 = ~Then again, if I had no legs, I would ache to walk.  I am still happier than many.  And I have you with me.  Who knows, perhaps one day I shall walk the streets of Evereska again, this time as a mighty ranger and a defender of Kuldahar?~
@1513 = ~I will be.  But who will ask?  I can always tell them I followed a different calling; drop in the name of Sehanine Moonbow.  Or Mielikki: they say her name always works.~
@1514 = ~Yes, we still have many miles to walk.~
@1515 = ~But we still have many miles to walk.~
@1516 = ~I do not know why I have thought of home just now.  I look at the dwarven forge, and the longing is suddenly so real...  Perhaps I have finally realized how far from home I am.~
@1517 = ~What about you, <CHARNAME>?  What is home for you?  Do you ache to return there?~
@1518 = ~No, I am not at all eager to return.~
@1519 = ~I have a home, and I would like to return there some day, if only to visit.~
@1520 = ~I am happy here with you, therefore I am home.~
@1521 = ~Oh, I am burning to return home!  I am not cut out for this life.~
@1522 = ~So many questions... and I have nothing to say.~
@1523 = ~I am sorry to hear this.  Perhaps one day you will find a different home, or the old one will become more welcoming with time.~
@1524 = ~Just as I do.  We are two of a kind, it seems.  Well, we and a few thousand of other wanderers, who, too, would like to return home one day, whether briefly or not.~
@1525 = ~This is more than I could have hoped for.~
@1526 = ~Yet you manage beautifully, so it is not hopeless.  And one day you will return.~
@1527 = ~Nothing?  Then there must be much to tell indeed.~
@1528 = ~Come, you can tell me more as we walk.  Or, if you prefer, I could tell you of Evereska.  Long ago, high amidst the Shaeradim...~
@1529 = ~How far can one go in their devotion, <CHARNAME>?  Freezing out villages?  Helpless animals?  How much further?~
@1530 = ~Your anger is misdirected.  I am not the one causing these things.~
@1531 = ~I would go even further, if my god demanded it.~
@1532 = ~Korin, I do not tolerate these things, either.~
@1533 = ~I cannot say.~
@1534 = ~Are you saying this on purpose, to spite me?  Or are you serious?  No matter; I do not wish to continue this conversation.~
@1535 = ~I am sorry, I was not angry at you.  I would've shouted at her for hours, but she was already beyond reason, and more so now.  Nevertheless, it is terrifying, what Auril and the likes of her do to men.~
@1536 = ~When I was younger, there were moments in my life, when I felt the world was watching me and rejoicing with me, when love was everywhere.  This is what faith is, I thought.  Hanali is love.~
@1537 = ~Then these moments became rarer.  I became more focused within myself, absorbed in my magic: it was a different kind of wonder.  Then I went into exile, but my faith never left me, not completely.~
@1538 = ~Maybe this is why I am so angry: these men and women, twisted and hardened by their ruthless deities, mock all that is sacred for me.  God cannot be hate.  Do you understand me?~
@1539 = ~I do, and I stand by you in this.~
@1540 = ~I think you've asked me this question before...~
@1541 = ~I would, but there is too much "faith" and "sacred".  Sorry.~
@1542 = ~I disagree.  Anger and hate give me strength and drive me forward.~
@1543 = ~Thank you.  I hope you will tell me of your own principles some time.~
@1544 = ~It is important that good friends understand each other, don't you agree?  Thank you.~
@1545 = ~No, I should be sorry.  I appreciate your patience.~
@1546 = ~(Korin hugs you, briefly, impulsively, and just as suddenly lets go.)~
@1547 = ~Yes, but is it love?~
@1548 = ~I feel tired.  You are more than a little fatigued, too, by the looks of it.~
@1549 = ~I am fresh as a rose, thank you!~
@1550 = ~Yes, some rest is in order.~
@1551 = ~I am not that tired, but resting now makes sense.~
@1552 = ~We have no time for this, Korin.  Come, we must press on.~
@1553 = ~I cannot pay compliments well at all, I see.~
@1554 = ~Before we rest, will you sit with me for a little while?  I wanted to talk about... the future.~
@1555 = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, do you envision your future clearly?  There's no need to tell me *how* you see it, just tell me if you do.~
@1556 = ~I do.  I know what I want to do with my life.~
@1557 = ~I am unsure.  I think I may need a few more years.~
@1558 = ~I do not know, and it frightens me.~
@1559 = ~I've never given it much thought.  What comes, comes.~
@1560 = ~This is good.  Then you know how important it is to have a calling.~
@1561 = ~You will find your calling, I know.~
@1562 = ~Yet you face your enemies with great bravery.  No, there is more to it.  There is more to you.~
@1563 = ~And what if it doesn't?  A century or more, lived in vain - it is not a pleasant thought.~
@1564 = ~Who determines whether our lives have meaning?  I do not know, and perhaps I never will.  I suspect it has something to do with love, and loving others, but I do not want to bore you to death with this talk.~
@1565 = ~I just wanted to know you better.  A little.~
@1566 = ~I think I'll sit and muse on my own future for a while.  We will win, I know it.  And I want to be sure I am ready to face what is to come next.~
@1567 = ~I'll be here, right next to the door.  Tell me when you are ready to turn off the lights.~
@1568 = ~I feel I am at peace now.  "I have found my calling" sounds pompous, but this is what I have done.  And you played no small part in this modest victory of mine.~
@1569 = ~So thanks are owed?~
@1570 = ~Did I really?~
@1571 = ~You are very welcome.~
@1572 = ~Nonsense.  You did it all by yourself.~
@1573 = ~(He leans toward you and kisses your lips lightly.)~
@1574 = ~Thank you.~
@1575 = ~You are welcome.~
@1576 = ~(Kiss him back)~
@1577 = ~Korin, I am sorry, but you are only a friend to me.~
@1578 = ~Not without you.  Without you I would stumble and be lost.~
@1579 = ~I will be a ranger, a wanderer, an adventurer, a messenger.  I will return to Evereska again, even if it takes decades.  I will remain by your side, if you would have me, or find my own calling, and, perhaps, meet you again years hence.~
@1580 = ~But one mystery remains unsolved.  What happened to me?  Who took my gift away, and how?~
@1581 = ~Do not dwell on it.  You will find out some day.~
@1582 = ~Is it important to you?~
@1583 = ~Perhaps you will never know.~
@1584 = ~The question does not haunt me as much as it did scant days after my loss.  It did not worry me in Easthaven at all: I was sleeping, contemplating.  But now... now I wonder.~
@1585 = ~(He is caught by surprise, and your lips brush his cheek, instead.  Korin hesitantly takes a small step forward... but the moment is gone.)~
@1586 = ~I know.  But I wanted you to know, too.~
@1587 = ~This may not be the right time, but this is my only time.  I have come to care for you deeply.  I am in love with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1588 = ~I know.  You kissed me, remember?~
@1589 = ~Are you sure?~
@1590 = ~So am I.~
@1591 = ~I am sorry, Korin.  Let us stay friends.~
@1592 = ~Oh, I do.  And so do you, I see.~
@1593 = ~I have never been more sure of anything in my life.~
@1594 = ~Before you say anything, let me finish, first.~
@1595 = ~I thought I was going down the route of self-discovery to find myself.  But I found only one thing: there is more, the path never ends.  And I am still in doubt about many things.~
@1596 = ~I wish I was whole and hale.  Then I could give you all I have.  Bliss, tenderness... I feel that some of it is locked inside of me, and I cannot reach out.  But whatever I can offer you, I will give.  I am yours... if you want me.~
@1597 = ~I will have it.  I love you, Korin.~
@1598 = ~I do.~
@1599 = ~I wish you well, but no.~
@1600 = ~I care for you, but you are only a friend to me.~
@1601 = ~This is my doom, then.  Let me say it one last time: I love you.  I will not repeat it again.~
@1602 = ~Then I will stand by your side as the one who loves you.  Come what may.~
@1603 = ~Ah, I would sit beside you, with your hands in mine, forever, but we must fight.  And so we will.  Poquelin will no longer threaten what is dear to us.  Afterwards... we will talk again.~
@1604 = ~(He leans over and kisses you on the lips.)~
@1605 = ~I am glad we are both alive.~
@1606 = ~Here ends the good news, I'm afraid.  Poquelin was right: Easthaven is under attack.  The temple is gone - is he trying to reach Jerrod's stone?~
@1607 = ~Probably.~
@1608 = ~I do not care.  We will stop him regardless.~
@1609 = ~Everard will know.~
@1610 = ~My hut has probably been destroyed, too, but never mind that now.  We'll go in a minute... only I have to tell you something, first.~
@1611 = ~I often snap my fingers, as if to conjure a few sparks, almost automatically.  You see, this is what most apprentice mages do at some point during their training.  It became a bad habit with me.~
@1612 = ~A few days ago, I did it... and I touched the Weave.  A blue spark appeared between my fingers.~
@1613 = ~I did it again, and again, but to no avail.  And I almost thought I dreamt it up, but as we were fighting in the lower reaches of Dorn's Deep, it appeared  again.  Then a purple spark, then two red ones.  My skill must be returning.~
@1614 = ~This is great news!~
@1615 = ~So, can I count on a few fireballs from you, when we fight the bastard?~
@1616 = ~What caused it?~
@1617 = ~Do not count on it: it may be years until I am able to repeat the simplest incantation.  But it's a start.~
@1618 = ~Let us not dwell on it.  We have more important things to do.~
@1619 = ~But to me it is a good enough indication that we will triumph.  The important part is not to die in the process.  You'll be careful, won't you?~
@1620 = ~Me?  Of course!  Word.~
@1621 = ~I am always careful.~
@1622 = ~And you?~
@1623 = ~Of course, of course.  Only a very careful person could plunge into this reckless venture.~
@1624 = ~We'll see if anything good comes out of it.  But I am inclined to say "yes".~
@1625 = ~Come to the window.  Do you see, there, between the pine and a small hill: a dark outline of a small house?~
@1626 = ~I do.  Is this your old hut?~
@1627 = ~Your house, isn't it?~
@1628 = ~Barely.~
@1629 = ~Yes, this was my home for a few blessed years.  We have come a full circle.  Although now I am much less sure of everything, and much happier.~
@1630 = ~I will take you there one day.  We'll have to remain here for a short while: to help, to provide, to protect.  And where else to stay?~
@1631 = ~You sound very sure of our victory.~
@1632 = ~Sounds like a plan.~
@1633 = ~I do not think we should stay in Easthaven.~
@1634 = ~Perhaps because I do not want to be sure of our defeat?  It is always best to trust the gods.~
@1635 = ~If I die, our plans will not matter, obviously - not for me.  But I fully intend to survive.  To look into your eyes, to talk to you, to hold you... and I have other, far-reaching plans.~
@1636 = ~Perhaps.  The Dale is huge; I haven't seen one tenth of it.~
@1637 = ~A new life, with old friends, new enemies, and new adventures to come.  And with you by my side.  I look forward to it.~
@1638 = ~But now we must rest.  I will reverie on the other side of the room - I need to concentrate.~
@1639 = ~Yes, let us do so.  And, Korin?~
@1640 = ~Korin... stay with me.~
@1641 = ~I have far-reaching plans, too.~
@1642 = ~I love you.~
@1643 = ~Will you stay with me?~
@1644 = ~I am sure of it.  Whenever you care to demonstrate, I will not be found wanting.~
@1645 = ~And I you.~
@1646 = ~A while ago, Teri asked me if it were possible to love two women at once.  Because the goddess of love is a woman, too.~
@1647 = ~I think I could tell her the answer now.  You can only love one.~
@1648 = ~Rest well.~
@1649 = ~Do you think it is possible for me to say no?~
@1650 = ~But I will.  Rest, love.  You need it.~
@1651 = ~It worries me.  I am not afraid of cold, but the people of Kuldahar are, and the Tree's powers are not boundless.  It is a threat that must be dealt with, and swiftly.~
@1652 = ~Do you think that Arundel spoke of this?~
@1653 = ~We will.~
@1654 = ~I shall be the one to decide that.~
@1655 = ~Nella, let us talk another time.~
@1656 = ~I wonder if Arundel knew... ?~
@1657 = ~Perhaps.  Or it will decide for us.  I would rather listen to Arundel's advice.~
@1658 = ~I know nothing about the forces he spoke of, but I know what I speak of when I say that a new, dangerous source of bitter cold lies here, in these parts, and this source is not natural.~
@1659 = ~It seems like every evil power in existence is taking up arms against Kuldahar and the Great Oak these days.  Why?  Why now?~
@1660 = ~Everybody wants power over these lands, and Kuldahar and its druids stand in the way.~
@1661 = ~Has it occurred to you that the Tree itself is not natural?~
@1662 = ~Why not?  It would have happened sooner or later.~
@1663 = ~It is a gift.  A marvellous gift - without it there would be no Kuldahar.  You saw it, you *felt* it.  Can it be unnatural?~
@1664 = ~I will find out who is behind this.  Whoever wants to get us out of the way will not succeed, I swear.  This is our home, these are our lives!  I shall never let go.~
@1665 = ~Can you feel the serenity in the air, <CHARNAME>?  The nature rejoices.~
@1666 = ~No, but I shall take your word for it.~
@1667 = ~We did the right thing, I know this much.~
@1668 = ~And a woman has been murdered.  I feel sorry for her.~
@1669 = ~So do I, for she could have been much more.~
@1670 = ~But in a way, I am as merciless as Lysan had been.  Just as she, I am unwavering in my devotion and set in my ways: I shall do anything to protect Kuldahar and the Tree.  Does this frighten you?~
@1671 = ~As long as it does not frighten *you*.~
@1672 = ~But you won't freeze people solid, will you?~
@1673 = ~Not at all.~
@1674 = ~It does, sometimes.~
@1675 = ~<CHARNAME>, be serious.  I would take arms against a woodchopper who'd have it in his head to cut the Great Oak, and then he'd be as dead as if Auril's breath entombed him forever.~
@1676 = ~You are honest.  Thank you.~
@1677 = ~Then you must have your own inner flame.  I admire that.~
@1678 = ~But there is a difference.  Auril's priestesses look at the world and dream of a huge frozen desert.  Druids of Kuldahar have been welcoming to non-druids in the shadow of the Great Oak for generations.~
@1679 = ~We can all live together.  But just living is not enough.  There is always evil about, and if let loose, it shall ruthlessly strangle the Tree and, perhaps, the North itself.  This is why the druids of Kuldahar stand guard by the Tree from the beginnings of time.  I know you will understand: you have seen it.~
@1680 = ~Why are you telling me this?~
@1681 = ~I do.  It is an admirable way to live, Nella.~
@1682 = ~There are other things in this world.  Don't you want to explore them?~
@1683 = ~You are my companion and my leader: you have a right to know.~
@1684 = ~And sometimes I have to remind myself that Lysan and I are not alike.~
@1685 = ~Thank you.  I am glad we spoke.~
@1686 = ~I have seen and travelled much when I was a child.  Here is where I am happiest.~
@1687 = ~<CHARNAME>, thank you.  You have given me a chance to help, to spare Arundel a part of the burden.  For this I am very grateful.~
@1688 = ~You are welcome, Nella.~
@1689 = ~The pleasure is all mine.~
@1690 = ~Was there something else you wanted to say?~
@1691 = ~Sure.  Now let us go, and quickly.~
@1692 = ~You have been a good leader to us towards this goal, and it is of leadership I wanted to ask you about.~
@1693 = ~Arundel says that many of those who become great leaders do so against or despite their will.  He smiled, looked at me, and said that with time, I may become one of them.  He was not serious, surely?  In any case, I am content to remain at his side and in shadow for as long as it is necessary.~
@1694 = ~But sometimes I look at the rising moon and wonder.  Do you wonder, <CHARNAME>?  Now that the Heartstone Gem is in your hands at last?~
@1695 = ~I often picture myself as a great adventurer and a hero, but I do not need nominal power.~
@1696 = ~I think I would have made a bad ruler.~
@1697 = ~Sometimes I wonder, too.~
@1698 = ~I do, and often.~
@1699 = ~Of course.  Power is my goal.~
@1700 = ~You have found your true calling, then. I am happy for you.~
@1701 = ~I do not know about that.  You have made a very good leader.~
@1702 = ~Power for the power's sake?  I hope you have a higher aim.~
@1703 = ~I have not been trained to be a leader or a holy warrior, but who has?  Experience is a painful teacher, but I will have no other.  I know, we will both learn.~
@1704 = ~Come, <CHARNAME>.  Let us bring some good into this world.~
@1705 = ~He... he isn't dead, no.  He has just been talking to me.~
@1706 = ~But now he is gone.~
@1707 = ~I am sorry.  I know how much he meant to you.~
@1708 = ~Let us honor his last wish and find Larrel.~
@1709 = ~And I will never talk to him again.  Never.  Never?~
@1710 = ~More than you possibly know.  More than anyone...~
@1711 = ~Who?  ... Oh, yes.  Yes, we must.~
@1712 = ~I am sorry, I must... pull myself together.  Please, leave me alone for a while... no, don't.  I do not want to be alone.~
@1713 = ~I will be here for you.  We all are.~
@1714 = ~Certainly.  If you need anything, just ask.~
@1715 = ~But you must survive this on your own.~
@1716 = ~Thank you.  I am lucky I have friends.  But this... this is hard.~
@1717 = ~I know.  But this... this is hard.~
@1718 = ~Arundel... no, I must hold on.  He would have wanted me to.  The Elders will see to the burial; I must honor his dying words.~
@1719 = ~Give me a moment, and I will be ready.  We all can talk later.~
@1720 = ~How much longer, <CHARNAME>?  I feel as if in a few more steps, something inside of me will simply snap.~
@1721 = ~Nella...  I understand, and I am sorry.~
@1722 = ~Have patience.  Arundel would have said the same.~
@1723 = ~Soon.  Wait with me.~
@1724 = ~It is up to you to master your pain.~
@1725 = ~If I close my eyes and strain my ears, I will hear millions of voices, consoling me.  The Great Tree, the sun, the wind, every grass blade, every living being.~
@1726 = ~But they are empty. They celebrate life, and I...  I cannot grieve forever, but the finality of his death... it kills me.~
@1727 = ~Arundel wouldn't want you to grieve.~
@1728 = ~Will you tell me more about Arundel?~
@1729 = ~Arundel was prepared for death.  He never kept any papers, or valuables, or indeed any unfinished business: he always finished his tasks in time.~
@1730 = ~Whoever comes after will find the cottage clean and welcoming, as if Master Arundel himself was about to greet the guest inside. I do not know if I can ever make myself step over the threshold.~
@1731 = ~Why am I telling you this?  Why do I keep talking?  Why can't I cease remembering?  <CHARNAME>, do you know?~
@1732 = ~No, I do not.  But for as long as you want to talk, I will listen.~
@1733 = ~Because you are in pain.~
@1734 = ~Because you miss him.~
@1735 = ~Is there anything I can do?~
@1736 = ~Take my hand.  Let us walk together for a little while.~
@1737 = ~Yes... no.  It is more complex than that.~
@1738 = ~Mages are attuned to the Weave, bards - to strange and wondrous melodies in their hearts.  I am no bard, but in my head, too, there is a melody.  It is clear and calling; everything around me is woven into it.~
@1739 = ~Now Arundel is gone, and there is a huge emptiness, a dissonance where there was once a symphony.  I have to learn a new tune... or lay down my instruments for good.~
@1740 = ~But this is empty talk.  Something will push me forward, and I will find it, when the right time comes.~
@1741 = ~Believe it or not, but I have been afraid of heights my entire life.  Have I told you how I used to climb the Tree when I was a girl of sixteen summers old?~
@1742 = ~No, you haven't.~
@1743 = ~Let me guess.  You are about to tell me?~
@1744 = ~You told Teri about climbing the Tree when you were eleven, and I have heard.~
@1745 = ~Nella, we do not have time for this.~
@1746 = ~I am.  Here it will be most appropriate.~
@1747 = ~Ah, so you have!  Well, here's more.~
@1748 = ~I used to reach the highest branches, sit, inhale the warm air and watch the sunrise over the mountain peaks.  Or the stars and distant fires at night, so late that it was impossible to tell which was which.~
@1749 = ~I grew older, Arundel started giving me missions, and I was spending more and more time away from Kuldahar.  Maybe this is why I stopped climbing the Tree.  At fifteen, I was terrified and exhilarated.  At twenty, I was only afraid.~
@1750 = ~What did Arundel think about it?~
@1751 = ~A familiar story.  As we grow up, the heights suddenly seem more imposing.~
@1752 = ~Are you still afraid?~
@1753 = ~Now that's strange; I never told him.  But I am sure he knew.  He also must've known I will overcome it sooner or later.~
@1754 = ~I stand here, on top of the highest tower, and I am still afraid.  But I believe the time has come to see the heights again.  To fly, and in the flight to find joy.  Would you like to fly, <CHARNAME>?~
@1755 = ~With you, my companions and friends?  Of course.~
@1756 = ~With you?  Of course.~
@1757 = ~(Kiss her)~
@1758 = ~As long as it doesn't include jumping from this tower.~
@1759 = ~I would.~
@1760 = ~To fly - in what sense?~
@1761 = ~I am glad.  Then we will fly together.~
@1762 = ~(Nella opens her eyes in shock, but does not push you back.)~
@1763 = ~(Whether she has enjoyed the kiss or not, it is hard to tell, but she does not withdraw until you do.)~
@1764 = ~This was unexpected.  Next time, tell me before doing it again, will you?~
@1765 = ~Hah!  No, it wouldn't.  I would never put a friend's life at risk.~
@1766 = ~When I say "fly", I mean the passage to victory.  The accomplishment of goals.  The joy of real flight.  Life, love, laughter.  And maybe, possibly - greatness.~
@1767 = ~But in the fortress of Severed Hand and here the animosity between the two races had horrible consequences.  Terrible things happened.  Can we do anything to prevent this?~
@1768 = ~Save siding with one of them and crushing the other, no.~
@1769 = ~Standing aside would be my guess.~
@1770 = ~Humans could act like cement in any coalition between the races.~
@1771 = ~We must build a better world, where every elf, dwarf and human views a being of another race as an ally, not an enemy.~
@1772 = ~Uniting in the face of the common enemy is the best way.~
@1773 = ~Nella, I do not have time for this.~
@1774 = ~No, it is not a solution.  I hope you are not serious.~
@1775 = ~Yes, it may work, and most probably will.~
@1776 = ~Yet it will take generations.  Does it mean all living dwarves, elves and humans should die for their prejudice, first?~
@1777 = ~Elves and dwarves already tried to unite in the face of the common enemy, but very few were able to do it.  You saw what happened in the Hand.  Yet if true evil threatened these lands, who can say?~
@1778 = ~So many ways, and each of them is flawed and difficult.  When Arundel was alive, it seemed so easy.  He spoke at length with members of dwarven clans and elven communities, halflings and even half-orcs: everyone was welcome to stay in Kuldahar, if they wished no evil to its people or the Tree.~
@1779 = ~Arundel was a beacon that brought us together.  Now that he is gone, I wonder if it is my responsibility now.  Am I ready to step into his place?~
@1780 = ~Who is?~
@1781 = ~It may take decades before you truly take his place, but it is worth doing.~
@1782 = ~You are too young and inexperienced, you know this.~
@1783 = ~Not yet.~
@1784 = ~Why would you want to?~
@1785 = ~I cannot answer.~
@1786 = ~Not yet, perhaps.  But if not me, then who?~
@1787 = ~I love Kuldahar.  It used to be *my* place, my natural home, so I feel I must protect it, shelter it.  But then there is so much I still haven't seen, so much to experience... experience it I must, if I want to step into Arundel's place in the fullness of time.~
@1788 = ~I will have to think on it.  Thank you for indulging me.~
@1789 = ~Arundel once showed me something very similar, but it was a calendar.  What is this?~
@1790 = ~A puzzle, and I know how to solve it.~
@1791 = ~It may well be a deadly trap.~
@1792 = ~I have no idea.~
@1793 = ~Nella, please, do not distract me right now.~
@1794 = ~Yes, it may.  Dwarves are very practical in these things.~
@1795 = ~We have to get past it, but it can be dangerous.  It will be.  So, before we do, I wanted to tell you something.~
@1796 = ~Over these days, I have started to rely on you more than I perhaps should have.  I...~
@1797 = ~Do not continue.  Nella, I love you.~
@1798 = ~It is natural between two good friends.~
@1799 = ~It is... far too early for such things.  I will not hold you to your words.~
@1800 = ~But it is time for something else.~
@1801 = ~<CHARNAME>, thank you.  You have been there for me, in danger and in grief and in dark places.  You supported me, and listened to me.~
@1802 = ~I know such debts are not to be repayed, only to be accepted with gratitude.  So I do... accept, and I thank you.  Should I be able to do anything for you in return, I will.~
@1803 = ~That's what friends are for.~
@1804 = ~I will be counting on you, then.~
@1805 = ~Thank you.  I had to say these words, before... well, just in case.  Shall we proceed?  Carefully.~
@1806 = ~Now that we are possibly stopping to rest, I want you to know that I have come to a decision, and I would like your opinion on it.~
@1807 = ~Please, speak.~
@1808 = ~What decision?~
@1809 = ~Nella, I really don't want to be involved.~
@1810 = ~Your advice is important to me - but you are right, it is my decision.  Very well, then.  Let us move on.~
@1811 = ~I will not lie to you - in time, I hope to return to Kuldahar and to take care of the Tree, as Arundel did before me.  You may call me ambitious, and possibly, I am, but it does not come out of the desire for power alone.  It is a calling of my heart.  I feel that the Tree knows, as I do, that in ten or twenty years, I may become its best guardian.~
@1812 = ~On our journey, I have seen and learnt much.  Yet I am not experienced enough, not wise enough, and not ready enough to accept this duty with joy.  I want to travel, not just to learn, but to adventure, cry, laugh and love.~
@1813 = ~I am proud to serve Kuldahar, and I shall be happy to return there, for a time.  But I feel that at this time we all must do our best... and I am afraid that my best will not be enough.~
@1814 = ~For the time being, the Elders and other druids are taking care of Kuldahar better than I possibly can, and it is as it should be: my place is here.  But even after the threat is gone, as my heart knows it will be, I would like to remain with you, my friends.  There will be other battles to fight in the months to come, other adventures.  Do you think I have made the right decision?~
@1815 = ~To stay with us, and not with the druids?  Yes.~
@1816 = ~I do not know, but I welcome your company.~
@1817 = ~You cannot shirk your duty.  When we are done here, you must return to Kuldahar at once.~
@1818 = ~I am sure it will be enjoyable, but are you sure this is wise?~
@1819 = ~I am not sure where my path is going to take me, Nella.  I cannot promise anything.~
@1820 = ~Thank you.  Adventuring with you has been... very special to me.~
@1821 = ~Some of the druids would say the same.  But my heart is telling me otherwise, and if there is anything Arundel taught me about, it was listening to my inner self.  Yet he also bade me to listen to the council of others.~
@1822 = ~I shall think of your words - and thank you.  Adventuring with you has been... very special to me.~
@1823 = ~I know, and I do not wish to force my company upon you - heavens, no!  But the least I could do was to tell you of my choices.~
@1824 = ~We still have a great enemy to fight. Shall we rest now?~
@1825 = ~I want to say I pity her, and I do, but it will come out as patronizing more than anything.  Ah, it's hopeless: she is dead and she needs neither my contempt nor my pity.  Did you hate her, <CHARNAME>?~
@1826 = ~No, I barely knew her.~
@1827 = ~She seemed merciless and cruel, and we needed her badge.~
@1828 = ~Yes, I did.~
@1829 = ~Nella, we cannot talk now.  Fire giants are upon us!~
@1830 = ~I wonder why she was alone.  Perhaps she put all her trust into the giants and into her master.  Or into her drow allies?~
@1831 = ~Well, neither helped her.~
@1832 = ~I suppose she had drow allies, yes.~
@1833 = ~Well, there was Malavon.~
@1834 = ~I do not care either way.~
@1835 = ~The drow... they are a mysterious race, are they not?  Cruel and evil, but there must be more to them, if even some of the surface elves are drawn to their dark kin.~
@1836 = ~I am almost tempted to explore these tunnels, though I know that no outsider will survive in a drow city, other than a slave.  Arundel told me that much.~
@1837 = ~Still, perhaps some day?~
@1838 = ~During the battle, I was afraid for you.  But I was even more afraid that one of us will fall, and I will never have a chance to say the words I want to say.  Now it seems like the most important thing in the world.~
@1839 = ~Do you remember how we stood together in Severed Hand, and you kissed me at the top of the highest tower?  I wanted to tell you since then.~
@1840 = ~I remember your confession, and I think it is time I answered.~
@1841 = ~I love you, too.~
@1842 = ~I just do not know what to say...~
@1843 = ~Nella, I am sorry.  I don't.~
@1844 = ~First Teri, now you.  I must be very lucky, but I do not feel this way towards either of you.~
@1845 = ~Say nothing.  Only... if you do not feel anything, say so now.~
@1846 = ~I love you, too, very much.~
@1847 = ~Of course not.  I feel the same way.~
@1848 = ~Then I will do so.  I am sorry, Nella.~
@1849 = ~Then I will bury the words.  Come, we must fight.~
@1850 = ~I am glad.  The spring has started.~
@1851 = ~What a joy.  I lost so much, but I found hope.  And now love returns.~
@1852 = ~It has always been here, with you.~
@1853 = ~And everything will be all right.~
@1854 = ~And to me.~
@1855 = ~We have to find Poquelin.  Then we will think about the future.~
@1856 = ~But we have one.  I know we do.~
@1857 = ~I want to plant a garden around Easthaven, when we are done here.  Apples, cherries, evergreen shrubbery and other small miracles.  I will be happy to stay and work for a while, to have a different purpose.~
@1858 = ~A great idea.~
@1859 = ~I will remain by your side.~
@1860 = ~Don't you want to return to Kuldahar?~
@1861 = ~My heart yearns to see Kuldahar again, but I know I will not linger there.  New lands call, and so strongly!  I may even want to leave the Dale with time.~
@1862 = ~To leave the Dale, the Ten Towns... incredible, isn't it?~
@1863 = ~Oh, but I am not alone.  Wherever you go, I go.  But I know you want to be aware of what I'm thinking of.~
@1864 = ~Of course.  I will always want to know, and I will always listen.~
@1865 = ~Yes, though I may disagree.~
@1866 = ~We will have to wait and see before forming our plans.~
@1867 = ~As long as you listen to my thoughts in return.~
@1868 = ~And I will always love you.~
@1869 = ~And we will have our first argument!  Oh, I am so looking forward to it.~
@1870 = ~And fight.  You are right, <CHARNAME>.  There will be time for reflection and planning later.~
@1871 = ~Always.  If I did not listen to you in Severed Hand, I may have never recovered.  For this only, I will never turn a deaf ear.~
@1872 = ~And now... no.  Should grow closer, as a woman and a man, I do not want it to happen here.~
@1873 = ~But I want it to happen.  Tomorrow... or in a few days?~
@1874 = ~This will be wonderful.~
@1875 = ~Or later.  We should not hurry into things.~
@1876 = ~A few days?  As soon as we throw Poquelin off the tower!~
@1877 = ~Take my hand, and let us rest.  Let the Great Oak bless our steps... and the road to victory.  Love you... sleep...~
@1878 = ~Of course.  I understand.~
@1879 = ~My, but you are insatiable.  And impatient.  I like it.~
@1880 = ~And it's only by lucky chance that we are alive, I know.  I still want to tell you the story, by the way.~
@1881 = ~Heh, why did I expect this answer?~
@1882 = ~It was my first, so I was nervous and sober.  And that's far worse than being nervous and drunk, let me tell you.  My nervousness mostly stemmed from the part that I'd been invited to entertain the cream of the city's society: merchants, nobility, even a Duke's daughter.  I thought I got incredibly, unbelievably lucky.~
@1883 = ~How did a young and inexperienced bard get such a lucrative deal?~
@1884 = ~Lucky indeed.  I am envious!~
@1885 = ~And you botched it?~
@1886 = ~Well... at the time, I thought I had a good skill: drinking ale with the right people.~
@1887 = ~I mentioned the word "rotten", didn't I?~
@1888 = ~I got friendly with the butler's son, and he recommended me to his parent's benevolent employers.  With a smirk, as I recall now.~
@1889 = ~Yes, he knew I was not that good, and, to be truthful, I knew it, as well.  But when the Lady of Luck is dancing naked on your table, you don't refuse such opportunities.~
@1890 = ~So, you hoped to impress the audience and failed?~
@1891 = ~Did he trick you?~
@1892 = ~I would have failed anyway.  The performance was jinxed.  Was I good?  I don't know.  Gah, I do not want to think about it.~
@1893 = ~Did he ever.  Well, yes and no.~
@1894 = ~As I started playing, a few guests broke into giggles.  I tried my best to ignore them, since only a poor bard starts adjusting his clothes at this time, but it didn't work: chuckles and snorts only got louder.~
@1895 = ~I panicked, but I never stopped playing.  Hah, they'd have to pry my hands from the instrument to get me to stop - I was a small statue of utmost terror.  You could start making moulds.~
@1896 = ~By the end of the song, fruits started to fly.  In high society!  At one point, I honestly thought I was having a bad, ugly nightmare.  Then the host's men closed in, and the worst part began: abuse.~
@1897 = ~All of a sudden, I was accused of bad playing, voice, clothes and pretty much everything, but my musical skills most of all.  Somebody suggested throwing me into the river, someone mentioned a sharp stick.  Finally, someone *very clever* remembered about tar and feathers.~
@1898 = ~Oh dear.  But why?~
@1899 = ~I understand now.  It was planned from the start, wasn't it?~
@1900 = ~You must've been terrified at that point.~
@1901 = ~Yes, indeed.  An entertainment of sorts, you could call it.~
@1902 = ~I was not as much frightened as shocked; regardless, I do not think I could resist.  The merciful part was that it was over pretty quick: in less than an hour.  Of course, it took well over an hour to clean myself.~
@1903 = ~As they flopped me into the gutter, the host threw a clinking bag next to me; it hit me on the nose.  Later, I found two hundred gold there - my pay.  It turned out that they planned to play this wonderful little trick on someone like me, and when the butler's son mentioned he knew a hapless fellow who'd be only too happy to assist for a few coins, my fate was sealed.~
@1904 = ~I am sorry to hear about it.~
@1905 = ~Are you still bitter?~
@1906 = ~Haha!  A funny story.  When I am rich, I will try it sometime.~
@1907 = ~Well, it could be worse: at least I got paid.~
@1908 = ~Me?  No, not as such.  I won't lie and say some especially nasty moments don't keep me up in the middle of the night, though.~
@1909 = ~You'll be surprised, but I'd rather you didn't.  There isn't much of a view on the receiving end.~
@1910 = ~If not for that performance, I might have never ended up here.  But that is a story for another time.~
@1911 = ~Admit it, <CHARNAME>, you're disappointed.~
@1912 = ~Me?  Why?  I like exploring ancient temples!  And empty altars at the end of the journey - why, they practically make my day!~
@1913 = ~This much is obvious.~
@1914 = ~Yes, I am.  Aren't you?~
@1915 = ~Actually, I expected this.~
@1916 = ~Severn, we do not have time for this.~
@1917 = ~Yeeesh, some of these altars hold fairly dangerous things.  Cursed daggers and ancient poisons, for one.  I suppose that's the bright side.~
@1918 = ~I am, too: I thought we'd be done by now.  But it seems we are in for a long haul.~
@1919 = ~Hmm, you and Arundel are not related, are you?  You can't surprise the old man, either.~
@1920 = ~Bet you fifty gold that Arundel, that very Arundel who never leaves Kuldahar and has no idea where the Heartstone Gem is, will send us to another terribly friendly place as soon as he learns the results of our little trip?  I think there's something he is not telling us.~
@1921 = ~But it's been not without its rewards so far.  I am glad you took me on the ride.~
@1922 = ~And I am glad I did.~
@1923 = ~Just make yourself useful.  *More* useful than now, that is.~
@1924 = ~Why, I think you are a terrific leader, too.  Very encouraging, for one.~
@1925 = ~Anyway, we'd better watch our backs.  Something tells me Arundel is not about to send us to a tropic bungalow next time.~
@1926 = ~And there's still this mysterious someone or someones who is either plotting our death or laughing hard by now.  Probably both, if he is your usual power-hungry maniac, "myahahahaha!" and all that rot.  It's worse if he's clever.~
@1927 = ~As clever as you?  I wouldn't worry, then.~
@1928 = ~And what happens then?~
@1929 = ~Yes, because he is turning Kuldahar to smoldering ruins as we talk.  Let's go, finally!~
@1930 = ~Oh, ha, ha.  Mock this hapless bard, will you?~
@1931 = ~He may win.~
@1932 = ~Listening and obeying, oh master.  I know, I should get myself a turban.~
@1933 = ~Wherever I go, I always end up covered in some sticky, smelly substance.  And I thought I'd have none of it in the Dale.~
@1934 = ~I told you about that performance with perks, didn't I?  Tar and feathers.  But I didn't tell you that I fled Baldur's Gate and boarded a ship to the Dale after it.~
@1935 = ~What, the next morning?~
@1936 = ~People gossiped and pointed fingers, didn't they?~
@1937 = ~Why Icewind Dale?~
@1938 = ~No, I took my time, though now I wish I hadn't.~
@1939 = ~Did they ever.  If that's what fame is like, no glory for me, thank you.  Let it favor the brave.~
@1940 = ~I do not know.  I wanted a radical change of scenery, I suppose.~
@1941 = ~Oh, all right, I might as well leave out nothing.  I was afraid.  Gossip travels fast, <CHARNAME>.  The morning after next, the entire staff of the Blade and Stars knew the story.  A tenday after, I had to change my lodgings for the third time and head to Beregost.~
@1942 = ~Half an *hour* after I started playing in the Jovial Juggler, a girl shrieked: "It's him!  The bard from Lady Silvershield's estate!"  I was done.  Or undone.  What could I do?  I headed straight to the harbor.~
@1943 = ~But why?  They would have forgotten this in a week.~
@1944 = ~Their loss, our gain.~
@1945 = ~Lucky for me.  It was a radical decision, though.~
@1946 = ~What happened to going about your business with your head held high?~
@1947 = ~I am a bard, <CHARNAME>.  A performer.  I *could* have started a new career as a jester, but no one's ever appreciated my jokes.~
@1948 = ~I am glad that I am here, and that you are here, minus the scenery.  But I am hoping to make a new start.~
@1949 = ~That's what I've been doing for my entire life, actually.  Making new starts.  When I kept sneaking away from the farm to listen to travellers' tales, when I tried my voice at a village performance, when I entered the Gate for the first time... now here.~
@1950 = ~I keep pushing my luck, but I'm liking it.  Maybe that's what it means, being an adventurer.~
@1951 = ~Maybe.  I guess everyone defines it for themselves.~
@1952 = ~Maybe.  But push your luck with me, and you are a dead adventurer, is this understood?~
@1953 = ~I hope making a new start does not mean leaving the group when you are most needed.~
@1954 = ~We are alike in this.  I hope you will find your calling sooner or later.~
@1955 = ~I don't know if you are a kindred spirit - mostly, because I'm not sure what it means.  But I know you are a friend.~
@1956 = ~Not unless you keep shoving me into the front lines.  A clean shirt is a bonus.~
@1957 = ~Joking, joking!  You don't have Tempus among your ancestors, do you?~
@1958 = ~And if you'd only find me a clean shirt, it could be love.~
@1959 = ~I cannot raise my hand against them.  If I were an elf, I'd collapse then and there.  I know we have to put them at rest, but doing it so violently doesn't agree with my stomach.~
@1960 = ~I could say the same.~
@1961 = ~I am not terribly happy about it, either, but this is what we must do.~
@1962 = ~Really?  I do not mind at all.~
@1963 = ~Severn, stop whining!~
@1964 = ~Ah.  Time to put on my turban, then.  Listeniiing and obeeeeying!~
@1965 = ~You were made of sterner stuff, then.~
@1966 = ~It's just unfair that when they do the recruiting, they never mention that you will have to fight against wan elven priests with empty eyes.  Or console a semi-transparent girl whose mother's corpse is probably dust by now.  Or mention looting at all.  I used to joke about it before, but it does not sound as funny now.~
@1967 = ~Eh, I am too serious.  By Tymora, it is an exciting adventure, a grand, if sad, tale, and I know we will find the bastard who did that to Arundel.  But there is a dark side to it, too, is all.~
@1968 = ~Agreed.  But it is a tale with a happy ending.~
@1969 = ~Let us hope it will end well.~
@1970 = ~It must be!  I did not come all the way from Baldur's Gate for nothing, did I?~
@1971 = ~It must!  I did not come all the way from Baldur's Gate for nothing, did I?~
@1972 = ~Well, where to now?  Upstairs or downstairs?  As long as it brings us to Larrel... and to some happy faces, for a change.~
@1973 = ~Eh.  Doesn't it tire you out?~
@1974 = ~It does.  I would rather walk under the open sky.~
@1975 = ~Yes, but I am not complaining.~
@1976 = ~I like being underground.~
@1977 = ~Severn, we have no time to talk.~
@1978 = ~So would I.  Dwarves have it easy,  I guess.~
@1979 = ~All right, all right. I can take a hint.~
@1980 = ~Lucky you.  Now, if you could be underground for the two of us...~
@1981 = ~When I was six, I fell into an ankheg hole.  I heard the chirping around me, and I nearly died of fright.~
@1982 = ~I only spent ten hours there, until my older brothers came and rescued me.  I was only a kid, but when I looked into their eyes, I saw fear in there.  They were even more frightened than me, because even together, they were no match for an adult ankheg, let alone the whole lair.  And unlike me, they knew this.~
@1983 = ~They were scared witless, but they had come for me.  I guess this memory is my guiding light, when I venture into the dark places.~
@1984 = ~A beautiful story.  Did either of them get hurt?~
@1985 = ~By reciting this memory, you were steeling yourself for our journey, weren't you?~
@1986 = ~That's why you are not comfortable underground, are you?~
@1987 = ~Why did you tell me only now, and not in the caves of Dragon's Eye?~
@1988 = ~Thankfully, no.  Bren's been nearly eaten by wolves the following winter, but that's another story.~
@1989 = ~More or less.  I am not a coward, but I am afraid.~
@1990 = ~In Dragon's Eye, I was scared of *everything*, from the skeletons to the lizards.  When we discovered the cult, I thought I'd faint: "Dear people, please, look into this on your own, and pick me up afterwards!"~
@1991 = ~Then it started to dawn on me that I am an experienced adventurer: I do not mind the smell so much, for one.  So I have to pick and choose my fears.  It's not a "I am afraid of EVERYTHING!" any more, but "I am all right with the dark and silence, but please, go easier on the undead."  And so on.~
@1992 = ~Still... underground.  Even if ankhegs are no longer a danger, I protest!  A hardened veteran or no, I want some sun and rain and daisies.~
@1993 = ~Daisies?~
@1994 = ~Heheh.  Thank you for lifting my spirits.~
@1995 = ~Severn, shut up.~
@1996 = ~Why not?  Better than lilies and asphodels, at any rate.  You can't go wrong with a daisy, as long as it's not on your gravestone.~
@1997 = ~Any time, <CHARNAME>.~
@1998 = ~Shutting up now, oh Great One.  (I knew!  I knew it would end like this!)~
@1999 = ~It did to me, and I am still looking for an answer.  What's yours?~
@2000 = ~I am <CHARNAME>.  I want to save Kuldahar.~
@2001 = ~I am <CHARNAME>.  I want power.~
@2002 = ~I want love.  I am me.~
@2003 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, and I want many things.~
@2004 = ~I do not know who I am, or what I want.~
@2005 = ~I would rather hear yours.~
@2006 = ~Severn, we will talk another time.~
@2007 = ~Ha!  To be this straight... I envy you.~
@2008 = ~That's sweet.  I could say the same, I guess.~
@2009 = ~As do I, though the moon from the sky seems off-limits.~
@2010 = ~I will tell you about myself, then.~
@2011 = ~That is, I would tell you, if there was anything to tell.  There isn't.  Born, bred, decided I was born a bard, like I told you at our first meeting.  That's it.  I've suspected I have some elven blood in me, but my mother never told, and my brothers never mentioned.  Probably just another wild idea.~
@2012 = ~You do look a bit like an elf.~
@2013 = ~I don't see anything of the sort.~
@2014 = ~Oh, never mind: I like imagining things.  Hey, I am a bard!  But I also like answers, and I wasn't able to find any.~
@2015 = ~They say there is a grand library in Candlekeep, but it takes a lot of money to even be allowed in.  And who knows if books even have answers?~
@2016 = ~And if they don't, where should I search for them?~
@2017 = ~What do you need these answers for?~
@2018 = ~Inside your head, where else?~
@2019 = ~Some book must have an answer.~
@2020 = ~I do not know, but asking me wasn't your greatest idea.~
@2021 = ~I know, I know!  But I needed someone to talk to.  I still do.~
@2022 = ~I have to know.  I keep searching in books, because older and wiser men wrote them.  If I were in their place, if I found the answers, surely I would like to pass them on?  Unless these answers would be too great and terrible to comprehend - no, don't mind me, just being melodramatic, as usual.~
@2023 = ~But then we entered the old, decaying library, and I thought: even if such a scroll existed, is it still readable?  And if it is, would I understand?  When the knowledge is passed from heart to heart, it is... easier.  But I have lost myself here.~
@2024 = ~Thank you for talking to me about this.  You are... well, it's just nice to be talking to you.  Thanks.~
@2025 = ~Hmm.  That's a good place to start!~
@2026 = ~Corpses of buildings, ghosts of doors... and more umber hulks.  A graveyard of memories.~
@2027 = ~You are being a touch too poetic, Severn.~
@2028 = ~And its inhabitants are now slaves or worse.~
@2029 = ~Severn, I am not in the mood right now.~
@2030 = ~I know, but there's nothing I can do about it.  The words just come.~
@2031 = ~I close my eyes and see maimed workers... those who lack eyes, ears, lips... and I can't think of anything else.  The visions are just *there*.~
@2032 = ~And won't go away.~
@2033 = ~Honestly, what monster would want to do it for his own amusement?  There is no profit in this, no sense, no... anything!~
@2034 = ~He is a sadist.  Plain and simple.~
@2035 = ~Maybe he has orders.~
@2036 = ~I don't know.  It was a large, vibrant city once.  Architects, miners, craftsmen, simple workers.  Who would want to destroy it?~
@2037 = ~The same person who wants to freeze Kuldahar and the Tree to death?  There is no point.  Chaos for the sake of chaos.~
@2038 = ~Perhaps it is his goal.~
@2039 = ~What if there is a pattern, and we just do not understand it?~
@2040 = ~It certainly looks so.~
@2041 = ~I don't know what to think, except that this has to stop.  No matter the cost.  I don't believe in higher destinies, but if I had one, I'd like it to be about this.  This place, Kuldahar, us and our enemy.  It is worth fighting for.~
@2042 = ~But I am not afraid now.  Not anymore.  It's so liberating!  Cyclops, crazy priests, crystal towers - I'll fight all these.~
@2043 = ~You have come a long road with me.~
@2044 = ~Good to hear it.~
@2045 = ~You have overcome your fear.~
@2046 = ~Thank you for supporting me in this, <CHARNAME>.  I feel we've really grown, all of us.  And it's been, how long, a few months?~
@2047 = ~Although I am supposed to be mad at you for stealing Teri from me.  I still love her to bits... no, never mind.  You two will be heading somewhere else now, anyway.  And I may even come with you a part of the way, who knows?~
@2048 = ~And I found Teri.  Half an hour ago, as you walked ahead, she came straight up to me and kissed me - just like that, and we are together.  My head won't stop spinning.~
@2049 = ~It's been a very rewarding road, and it taught me a lot.  Even the sad bits, even the bitter bits, even the burnt and crunchy bits - but that's enough about my cooking.  Thank you, <CHARNAME>.  Just figured I'd tell you, before we both get blown to bits ourselves.~
@2050 = ~Severn, ever an optimist.~
@2051 = ~Thanks.~
@2052 = ~We won't.~
@2053 = ~(Severn makes a move to shake your hand, but at the last moment, he changes his mind and pulls you into a hug.)~
@2054 = ~Give me a hasting enchantment, and I'll make an omelet of anything that moves.  Or lurches.  Or, as it stands, jiggles.~
@2055 = ~Hmm, now, that's a fair question.  Do skeletons jiggle?~
@2056 = ~I think they rattle, actually.~
@2057 = ~Of course they do!  They jiggle in a jig!~
@2058 = ~Teri, we don't have time for this.~
@2059 = ~Point.~
@2060 = ~Skeletons dancing a jig!  Haha!  Must be an endearing sight.~
@2061 = ~Right.  Tombs to loot - how could I have forgotten?  The first enchanted sword I see is mine!~
@2062 = ~You know, you are all right.  You make me smile, and that counts.  I think we'll be friends.~
@2063 = ~I hope so.  I like you, Teri.~
@2064 = ~Maybe, but not just yet.  I hardly know you.~
@2065 = ~What makes you think I want to be friends with you?~
@2066 = ~Thank you, I am flattered.  Can we get to business now?~
@2067 = ~Thanks, but you'll like me more when I've washed my hair.  Ugh, zombie goo!~
@2068 = ~Come!  The faster we finish here, the sooner I can do something about it.~
@2069 = ~Pfft!  We've got all the time in the world.  Anyway, is friendship really about time?  You either like someone, or you don't.  And we are off to a good start.~
@2070 = ~Hmm... let me think.  Yes, I think it was a deliberate offense.  I'll go over there to sulk now.  And don't you dare to withhold my share of the treasures while I'm at it!~
@2071 = ~I won't pretend I am not nervous.  You see, back in Amn, I was arrested in a temple, and then sentenced to hang.  I don't exactly *avoid* them these days, but "they make me a trifle uncomfortable" is an understatement.~
@2072 = ~Will you tell me more about your time in Amn?  I am curious.~
@2073 = ~So, why didn't they hang you for thievery?~
@2074 = ~I can understand this.~
@2075 = ~They never had a chance.~
@2076 = ~I'd better tell you the whole story about my fabulous escape.  You'll be surprised, but what I told you in Easthaven is actually true.  I never thought that one day, I'd be locked in a duel of wits with one of the merchant princes of Athkatla.  But what is the point of setting your sights low?~
@2077 = ~The man's name was Arlen Keht.  They call young men such as he "merchant princes" in Athkatla, and oh, I liked the name.  But if you are thinking of an old-fashioned romance, you are mistaken.  We talked in person only once, on the day of my capture and my departure.  Before that day, we spoke through action, through rumor, through intrigue.  It was an exciting game.  Arousing, too.  And I was winning... if not for that once.~
@2078 = ~I lost in the House of Waukeen, where he paid his respects to the goddess.  He must have spent over a thousand gold to cover his expenses.  Mercenaries, guards, dogs...  The old priest said I deserved what I got.  Pah!  What does he know?~
@2079 = ~Were you in love?~
@2080 = ~Thieving *is* bad, Teri.~
@2081 = ~I liked the game, but I barely knew him.  He probably was married, too... strange, but I never found out.~
@2082 = ~Uh-huh.  And robbing the dead must be noble and pure.  Let's save ourselves the trouble and close the subject right away.~
@2083 = ~Arlen dismissed everyone, saying he wanted to interrogate me himself.  His bodyguards departed, leering.  *sigh* Fools.~
@2084 = ~He gave me one minute to choose: Icewind Dale or the gallows.  I answered at once: I wanted to live.  As he helped me up, he admitted that he, too, grew fond of our duel, and he'd never have forgiven himself if he let his guards slaughter me.  I was flattered.~
@2085 = ~I... I think I found a friend in him.  Maybe one day I'll return to Athkatla to say thanks.~
@2086 = ~A fascinating story.  Thank you.~
@2087 = ~And you are not exaggerating?  Not at all?~
@2088 = ~I should thank him, too.  I enjoy your company very much.~
@2089 = ~What a story!  But you don't seem *that* competent, Teri.~
@2090 = ~Maybe you should.  Shall we move on?~
@2091 = ~Find me a pair of emeralds, and we're even.  But...~
@2092 = ~Well...~
@2093 = ~Oooh, a silver tongue!  Well, well.  I shall remember that.~
@2094 = ~I... think I should add something.~
@2095 = ~I am rather good, if I say so myself.  Besides, his guards were frankly dumb.  But...~
@2096 = ~Yes, let's.  And if this Heartstone Gem is not around, somebody's going to lose a limb.  But...~
@2097 = ~Yes, he called me an annoying pest, and, no, I do not think he paid me that much attention.  I think he just took pity on a scrawny girl with matted hair and shining eyes, or some other nonsense.  I got lucky.  But it was good fun, all in all.~
@2098 = ~"I have a war to plan," pfft!  Do you think morons like these have the Heartstone Gem in their possession?~
@2099 = ~I think they serve those who do.~
@2100 = ~I do not know.  We will have to see.~
@2101 = ~Probably not.~
@2102 = ~What does it matter?  Kill them all and loot their bodies until they yield the Gem, I say.~
@2103 = ~I am sorry, we cannot talk right now.~
@2104 = ~Even greater morons, eh?  Heheh.  Maybe.~
@2105 = ~Right, right, you do not know, but can't you guess?  Half the enjoyment's in anticipation.~
@2106 = ~That's what I am saying, too.~
@2107 = ~Haha!  Good thinking.~
@2108 = ~I do not remember if I told you, but my parents are adventurers.  *Are*, yes, they are still alive, which means they are fairly good.  My father says that my mother is a restless spirit, and she says the same of him.  Neither is in any hurry to retire.~
@2109 = ~I want them to be proud of me.  And I want me to be proud of me.  You know what I mean: I want to wake up each day and to be happy that I'm me.  And I want to be famous.  I want to be adored, respected and well-known, I really do.~
@2110 = ~So, as we walk, I ask myself: is the quest for the Heartstone Gem grandiose enough for Teriel Gilethir?~
@2111 = ~Teriel Gilethir?~
@2112 = ~Rescuing an artifact of great power for a mysterious Archdruid?  What's not to like?~
@2113 = ~Perhaps not grandiose enough.  But it is a good deed.~
@2114 = ~If it is good enough for me, it certainly should be good enough for you.~
@2115 = ~Why is being famous so important to you?~
@2116 = ~Still better than Alustriel Silverhand, isn't it?  I like it, but I prefer Teri.~
@2117 = ~Weeell... we searched two fairly large tombs already.  Both times it proved fruitless.  It might be good enough for you, but we'd better find the bauble this time, that's all I am saying.~
@2118 = ~And as each good deed, it will not go unpunished.~
@2119 = ~I know that I don't owe anybody anything, least of all my parents.  They simply want me to be happy, the way I see it.  But my mother is fifty-five, and she is aging fast.  I know how short a life can be, and I do not want to waste a single moment of it.  And if others acknowledge my prowess, it is a good enough proof of a life well-lived, isn't it?~
@2120 = ~But I am getting too serious for my taste.   We have enemies to banish, remember!~
@2121 = ~Arundel said that this Heartstone Gem is used for divination, isn't it?  It is a powerful scrying stone.  Just think of it: you could put it to use, as well, to see your own future.  Would you want to?~
@2122 = ~Oh, I can foretell my future well enough.  I shall recover the Heartstone Gem on the lowest level of the Dragon's Eye, bring it back, locate the source of this evil, set on a quest to exterminate it, fulfill my mission, marry you and live happily ever after.~
@2123 = ~Oh, I can foretell my future well enough.  I shall recover the Heartstone Gem on the lowest level of the Dragon's Eye, bring it back, locate the source of this evil, set on a quest to exterminate it, fulfill my mission and live happily ever after.~
@2124 = ~It is tempting.  But I shall forge my future myself.~
@2125 = ~Of course!  Who is forewarned is armed.~
@2126 = ~Teri, please, not now.~
@2127 = ~Hmph!  And where is my engagement ring with huge diamonds, I'd like to ask!~
@2128 = ~A-ha!  So you've given it some thought.~
@2129 = ~I am tempted, too.  More than tempted, I should say.  I am itching to grab this gem and to peer into its depths... eh.  Well.~
@2130 = ~Divination requires skill, and a powerful artifact requires careful handling.  And, between us two, I wouldn't put it past Arundel to lay a warding charm on it, something that no one but an accomplished spellslinger is able to break.~
@2131 = ~Damn!  I want to see my future!  It's not as if I was about to sell it, or anything of the kind!  Why is it so unfair?  The gem is only useful to the old sages, who, truly, do not have much of a one.~
@2132 = ~This is more than a little cruel, Teri.~
@2133 = ~You know that a powerful artifact should not fall into the wrong hands.~
@2134 = ~I agree.  Just think of all the things we could do if we knew the future!~
@2135 = ~Perhaps we can figure out something...~
@2136 = ~I know, but I cannot help it.  They are so smug, these venerable sages!  Though Arundel is different... but he would advise against using the Heartstone Gem for our own purposes anyway, I just know it.~
@2137 = ~Pfft!  And who holds it now, Ilmater's brotherhood?~
@2138 = ~Perhaps once we are powerful enough... ?  Or a wandering sage wanders by...  They tend to wander, these wandering sages, did you know that?~
@2139 = ~I want to know if something bad is going to happen before it does... and I just want to know the future.  As much of it as I can.~
@2140 = ~<CHARNAME>, as a wise and worthy leader, surely you will not begrudge your tired companions an hour of rest?~
@2141 = ~Of course not.  Make yourself comfortable.~
@2142 = ~If you insist, but if you are keeping a tab on me, put it as a huge sacrifice on my part.~
@2143 = ~Rest?  What rest?~
@2144 = ~Teri, we do not have time for this.~
@2145 = ~Thank you!  Here, I graciously allow you to stretch next to me on this luxur... um, dusty bed.~
@2146 = ~Sure thing!~
@2147 = ~Rest!  Stretching your arms and legs, letting your body relax, drinking and eating, exchanging stories and explicitly NOT walking, slaying somebody, or performing missions for that somebody OR for somebody else.~
@2148 = ~But I see an explanation is wasted on you, so I'll just get to the point.~
@2149 = ~There is something I want to talk to you about.  Do you remember our conversation about the Heartstone Gem?~
@2150 = ~I do.  What of it?~
@2151 = ~Why do I have a feeling you are planning something risky?~
@2152 = ~We are not archmages, and we cannot do powerful divination, this we know.  But what about using it as an ordinary crystal ball, and reading our futures in its depths?  How about testing your heart?  Just you and me and the Gem - no trespassers allowed.~
@2153 = ~What a good idea!~
@2154 = ~Why not?  Let us try it.~
@2155 = ~No, and it is a firm no.~
@2156 = ~Hmph.  Don't you think I really wanted to.~
@2157 = ~Take my hand, and look...~
@2158 = ~I see... the sea.  I am sitting on the shore, on a wet black rock, staring at the sky.  Oh, the sunset is beautiful!  I am waiting for someone... am I?~
@2159 = ~I hear footsteps... and a warm hand on my shoulder.  A voice, familiar, but the sound is so dim... ?  I want to turn around... ah!~
@2160 = ~Damn.  Gone.  And it was such a vivid piece of imagination, too.  Or was it real?  I *was* there... wasn't I?  In any case, it is your turn, <CHARNAME>, and don't you try to wriggle out of it!~
@2161 = ~I cannot see anything.  I am sorry.~
@2162 = ~I see a house.  So warm, so welcoming...~
@2163 = ~A road.  It goes on and on...~
@2164 = ~I am on a ship, fencing and feinting...~
@2165 = ~Dancing with a mysterious stranger... who looks so, so familiar...~
@2166 = ~Flying high in the skies, laughing, so free...~
@2167 = ~Sitting on a richly carved throne in a huge hall...~
@2168 = ~Walking through some city in tattered clothes, in the pouring rain...~
@2169 = ~I would rather keep what I saw to myself.~
@2170 = ~That's all right.  I haven't seen anything much, either.~
@2171 = ~If you want.  I won't pretend I don't want to hear anything about it, mind you.~
@2172 = ~A house and a home, hmm?~
@2173 = ~And we must pursue it while we can!~
@2174 = ~O-ho!  So it was you in my vision?  <CHARNAME>, a dashing pirate?~
@2175 = ~You tease!~
@2176 = ~Ah, a romantic.  You are making it up as you go, aren't you?~
@2177 = ~A mighty ruler!  Rich, too, eh?  Hmm... any gold and jewels for the old friends?~
@2178 = ~Oh.  Eh.  I suggest you exchange futures with someone else.  Promptly.  And mine is taken, remember!~
@2179 = ~The future is such an infuriating beast, isn't it?  I want to know it, whens and hows and whos, and when I do, all I want is to change it.~
@2180 = ~Though that vision on the sea shore was tempting... very.~
@2181 = ~What makes you smile, <CHARNAME>?  Smile, laugh, and forget about this sad place?  No, wait.  I know what you'll answer: good meal, good company, pleasant weather.  Right?~
@2182 = ~Yes, but not here.  It is difficult to smile in this place.~
@2183 = ~I suppose so.~
@2184 = ~Not only that.~
@2185 = ~That's what I meant.~
@2186 = ~All right, money, victory, revenge, respect, admiration, glory, all things you can buy for money, and everything you can't.  Or a flower in high summer.  Whatever.~
@2187 = ~It's not hard to be happy, even for an hour.  But not here.  Ever since we entered this place, I feel... cold.  Cold and alone, and lonely.  I, um, may even need a hug.  I realize there is a huge queue waiting to perform this astonishing feat and crush me in their mighty arms or caress me in their gentle ones, so I do not mean it literally.  But... yes.  Small and lonely.~
@2188 = ~Poor Teri.  Let me give you a hug!~
@2189 = ~What can I do?~
@2190 = ~And very pretty.~
@2191 = ~Are you finished?  Now it is my turn.~
@2192 = ~Hey!  Step back, it was just a metaphor!  A metaphor, I tell you!~
@2193 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, I thought you were a wise, experienced leader!  Of course you can do nothing - people come to you just to be listened to, not to receive a ready solution.~
@2194 = ~Ha!  That's one more way to make me smile, sure enough.~
@2195 = ~Your turn!  If you feel sad, or wretched, or... well, anything goes.  I'll listen.   Have you noticed my thoughtful, compassionate, understanding expression?  Hmm, I think I've overdone the "compassionate" part.~
@2196 = ~Thank you for your compassion, Teri, but I will manage on my own.~
@2197 = ~Where to start?  Everyone around me dies, and I do not like this one bit.~
@2198 = ~I am all right.  It is an exciting adventure, and the ghosts only add to it!~
@2199 = ~I feel unhappy, too.  Or maybe just anxious, unsure.~
@2200 = ~This place is very depressing.  I am sure I will be better outside.~
@2201 = ~Managing is not the thing.  Everyone can manage.  Living happily, now - that's difficult.~
@2202 = ~That's the spirit!  I already feel better.  "Add to it", heh... sometimes you *are* good with words.~
@2203 = ~Let us finish here soon, then.  Once outside, things will change.  Less death, more life.  More sun, too.~
@2204 = ~But first, I want a nice long talk with this Larrel fellow.~
@2205 = ~I have been talking to others, and they all have great designs.  Becoming a great leader, a renowned adventurer... no, no, I didn't mean that.  I want to become a great adventurer, too, but this is what we *do*!  After all, nobody expects you to want to become a bad one.~
@2206 = ~No, I mean a purpose.  Everyone seems to have a goal: they know what they want to do with their lives.  And I don't.~
@2207 = ~Too bad for you.~
@2208 = ~Why would you need to know that?~
@2209 = ~Teri, how old are you?  Methinks thou dost hurry too much.~
@2210 = ~What would you like to do with your life?~
@2211 = ~Because I'm me!  What do you expect me to do, sit and wait until some higher entity delivers it to me on a plate?~
@2212 = ~What I am doing now is pretty much like I've always imagined it to be.  And, um, maybe even better.  In certain ways.~
@2213 = ~Mock if you will.  I am deadly serious!  Deadly, sharply, and... and possibly fatally!  So there.~
@2214 = ~I guess I'm not even looking for a goal, but the sense that I have a goal, if you see my meaning.  It doesn't matter if I don't know where I am heading, if I feel I *am* heading somewhere, not drifting with the current.  Even if this current goes down a moonlit stream.~
@2215 = ~Yes, I see your meaning.  What about saving Kuldahar?  Isn't it a worthy goal?~
@2216 = ~You are a poet, Teri.~
@2217 = ~Better to drift down a moonlit stream than head down towards a waterfall at full speed.  If you see my meaning.~
@2218 = ~Then I wish you luck in finding what you seek.~
@2219 = ~It is now, but the year after?  I appreciate that you are trying to help, but I am stuck.~
@2220 = ~Must be hereditary.~
@2221 = ~I do, I do.~
@2222 = ~Thank you.  I accept well-wishes, donations to the worthy cause of saving my skin, and other tributes at all times.~
@2223 = ~Maybe I should settle down near some forest lake, pose as a local water-nymph and set out to frighten the villagers?  Or something else as crazy?  Ah, don't mind me.  But - thanks.~
@2224 = ~I'd like to breathe fresh air again.  We could visit Kuldahar again, or just walk around for a bit.  I can't imagine wandering more caves.~
@2225 = ~I am tired of the underground, too.~
@2226 = ~Too bad.  We have a task to complete.~
@2227 = ~Neither do I.  I thought it'll be Icewind Dale, not Icewind Caverns!~
@2228 = ~Let's discuss it later.  I want to know where we are.~
@2229 = ~But I am glad I have you with me... er, that you have me with you.  We've become friends, haven't we?~
@2230 = ~Yes, I dare say we have.~
@2231 = ~Not really.  Travelling companions, no more.~
@2232 = ~Oh, yes.  And a very pretty friend you are.~
@2233 = ~Thank you for saying that.~
@2234 = ~Hmm.  Maybe so, but then you've spent so much on my equipment and rations that we must be dear companions indeed.~
@2235 = ~I am, am I?  Nice of you to notice.~
@2236 = ~And as your dear companion, I implore you to let us return to Kuldahar!  Or to see Larrel again; he must know what happened in these halls.  See, I'm an experienced blackmailer.~
@2237 = ~And I love you for this.~
@2238 = ~Why, Teri, you *are* a rogue!  Got me good and proper.~
@2239 = ~Maybe we will.  I won't promise anything.~
@2240 = ~But to do so, we might have to go back down these halls, and that's a long way.~
@2241 = ~Must be my unearthly beauty, grace and charm, I just know it.~
@2242 = ~Heheh.  I try, I try.  By the way, here is your ring back.~
@2243 = ~I know, I know.  Just saying.~
@2244 = ~Well... yes, but maybe something will turn up?  Another elevator, a magical portal, a bored archmage?  Something.~
@2245 = ~Anyway, just think about it, all right?  Please.~
@2246 = ~I don't want to exaggerate, but another couple of whipping, burning and smouldering monsters, and I will be pretty much walking naked.~
@2247 = ~I'd like to see that.~
@2248 = ~Oh-ho!~
@2249 = ~I am sure it will not come to that.~
@2250 = ~Laugh, if you will, but I am serious.  Oh, yes, leathers survive.  Plates survive.  But what about pants, excuse my Amnian?  What about my skirt, together with various other frilly and dainty articles?  I am sure you know just *what* I am talking about.~
@2251 = ~I am doomed to walk in the altogether, and I don't want to, so let's talk business.  How about sharing your spare clothes with me?~
@2252 = ~But we are not the same size!~
@2253 = ~Teri, you are not trying to seduce me, are you?~
@2254 = ~Why don't you ask someone else?~
@2255 = ~All right.~
@2256 = ~Oh, I'll let out here, cut there... you know how it goes.  Don't worry about it!~
@2257 = ~Heh.  Now, *you* in the buff - that'd be a sight!  But, no, no.  I mean, erm, not now.~
@2258 = ~They'll have a reason to refuse!  They'll think of anything, I tell you, because they're ashamed of their smelly clothes.  But you have the responsibility, so you cannot say no.~
@2259 = ~You agree?  And that easily, too?  Today is my day!~
@2260 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.  You saved this rogue a-, um, life.~
@2261 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>.  I am nervous, and I don't want these monsters or slaves or whoever to be ogling me.  Of course, that's uncharitable to slaves, but I'm just this cruel.  Please?~
@2262 = ~All right.  I'll see if I can find a spare tunic or two.~
@2263 = ~Perhaps we'll find a new armor, or something.~
@2264 = ~Ah, but an armor won't do!  I told you, it's-~
@2265 = ~Oh, never mind.  I'll... talk to someone else.  Privately.~
@2266 = ~<CHARNAME>, what is romantic love for you?  When I think of my own feelings, I feel I am totally lost.  In darkness, and without a map.~
@2267 = ~I think I am slowly falling in love, but I am not sure.  It is a wonderful feeling, though.~
@2268 = ~You are hurting day and night, and your beloved's words mean more to you than the entire universe.~
@2269 = ~It passes, but care and affection remain.~
@2270 = ~It is something beautiful.  Majestic.~
@2271 = ~All love is unrequited.~
@2272 = ~Why does it concern you so?~
@2273 = ~But this fluttering is so fragile!  As if it would be blown away at any moment...~
@2274 = ~Pain, pain, and nothing else in the entire world matters?  No, I cannot accept that.~
@2275 = ~It sounds so sad.  How come, when true love among elves is eternal?  But maybe even elves have forgotten how to love forever.~
@2276 = ~Ha!  Anyone could say that.  But you get bonus points for saying it with conviction.~
@2277 = ~That would be too... no.  Although, yes.  Damn!  And I thought I was lost!~
@2278 = ~Because I'm me, why else?  But if you do not want to answer... ?~
@2279 = ~I don't.~
@2280 = ~Oh, really?  Heheh.  Who would have thought.~
@2281 = ~I don't know why I asked.  It's just... sometimes I don't know what I feel, myself.~
@2282 = ~Are you trying to tell me something, Teri?~
@2283 = ~Do you need advice?~
@2284 = ~That makes two of us.~
@2285 = ~Oh, no, no.  No.  No!  Stop looking at me like that, please.~
@2286 = ~I know things will get ugly soon, with these badges and strange messages and deaths and screams in the distance, but... I liked it.  Every moment of it.~
@2287 = ~But never mind me.  Back to screaming battle cries!~
@2288 = ~<CHARNAME>, imagine you are in love.~
@2289 = ~I do not have to.  I am already in love with Nella.~
@2290 = ~I do not have to.  I am already in love with you.~
@2291 = ~What for?~
@2292 = ~Wait and see.  You will know what I mean soon enough.~
@2293 = ~So, you're in love.  Imagine that you don't know how she feels about you.  You'd like to know - you are ready to steal and use the Heartstone Gem, no less! - but you don't.  And you are wondering, wondering and wondering, but you are afraid to approach the subject of your feelings.~
@2294 = ~And maybe there is some other bard, who says openly he... er, she... is in love with you, but you are still wondering about your - about the other, so you just don't know what to answer!  Because from the start, you've been thinking about someone else.~
@2295 = ~So you decide to talk openly and to learn about his - damn, I meant her! - feelings, because you think it's the only way.  What do you think she will tell you?~
@2296 = ~She?  You mean, he?  That is, you mean, me?~
@2297 = ~She... er, he... will answer that he is in love with you, and that he is grateful to you for this confession.~
@2298 = ~He will say that he is sorry, but he does not feel this way about you.~
@2299 = ~Teri, I really do not understand what you are talking about.~
@2300 = ~What about Severn?  I thought he cared about you.~
@2301 = ~He does, and I care for him, but I also have feelings for someone else, stronger feelings.  Which is why I want your advice.~
@2302 = ~Ah, what the hell.  Yes, <CHARNAME>, I meant you and you alone.  You and me.~
@2303 = ~If you want to tell me that you are in love with me, then I would like to tell you the same.~
@2304 = ~Yes.  An emphatic yes to you and me, together.~
@2305 = ~I would prefer if we remained friends.~
@2306 = ~Teri, I am sorry... no.~
@2307 = ~Ah.  I am sorry; I wish you happiness.~
@2308 = ~But I am not sorry I asked.~
@2309 = ~You... ?~
@2310 = ~(She flings herself into your arms.)~
@2311 = ~Yay, happiness!~
@2312 = ~You - are you all right?~
@2313 = ~Fine.~
@2314 = ~Great!  Poquelin isn't, though.  Hopefully.~
@2315 = ~Mmmph!  What was that for?  Ah, for me, of course.  Shouldn't have asked.~
@2316 = ~Seems you are in perfect shape.~
@2317 = ~I feel like a princess in a fairy taile.  Truly.  We've driven the villain to hiding, we are winning, and we will protect these lands.  And I have my prince... all right, forget the shining armor part.  In fact, forget the prince part, too, if you are not comfortable with it.  I like *you*, not some image.~
@2318 = ~You've been in love with me for a while, haven't you?~
@2319 = ~I do not mind being a prince in the shiny armor, if that's what you want.~
@2320 = ~Thank you. I prefer to be myself.~
@2321 = ~No need.  It is you I am after.~
@2322 = ~That's what I thought.~
@2323 = ~I can't say I fell in love with you from the start.  But in Dragon's Eye... I looked at you, once, and there was this something about you, a halo of sorts.  And there was this swooping sensation, and... and... yeah.  Um.  Must be love.~
@2324 = ~Must be.~
@2325 = ~Sometimes I feel like a cradle-robber.~
@2326 = ~Could be love, could be a simple fascination.~
@2327 = ~Why didn't you tell me earlier?~
@2328 = ~Pfft!  If someone is a cradle-robber, it's me.  Because I'm old and wise and experienced.  What, you don't believe me?~
@2329 = ~I am fairly sure I am in love with you... and deeply, too.  Ahem.  It's awfully awkward to be sincere.  But I may grow to like it.~
@2330 = ~I haven't told you earlier, because I knew you'd say "no".  Never mind if I was wrong, I just couldn't make myself do it.~
@2331 = ~Besides, I wasn't *sure*.  How can you tell that you are really in love?  That you are ready to spend the rest of your life with someone - and I wouldn't have it any other way?  You need time, and then some more time.  And then... I knew.~
@2332 = ~Wait, wait, what was it about the rest of someone's life?~
@2333 = ~I am quite willing to spend my life with you.~
@2334 = ~Teri, I care for you, but I am not so sure about being together forever.~
@2335 = ~I am glad you did.~
@2336 = ~Hmm?  Oh, we can discuss marriage later.~
@2337 = ~(Teri clings to you, puts her head on your shoulder and sighs.)~
@2338 = ~First we did not talk of love, because I was unsure.  Now we don't talk of it, because we are too happy or too busy?  Or abashed?  No, enough of that.~
@2339 = ~<CHARNAME>, sleep with me here, tonight.~
@2340 = ~Not now, Teri.  This is not the right time.~
@2341 = ~Gladly.~
@2342 = ~Your wish is my command.~
@2343 = ~I would not say no to that.~
@2344 = ~Hey, we may die upstairs!  Or downstairs.  I don't know what this crystal tower is all about.  Don't you want to... try it?~
@2345 = ~And what if we do die, or one of us dies?  It would be too bitter.~
@2346 = ~All right, you have convinced me.~
@2347 = ~Try it?  You've never done it before?~
@2348 = ~Teri, no.~
@2349 = ~Good.  You look very inviting, <CHARNAME>.  In various ways.~
@2350 = ~Well, I tried.~
@2351 = ~What do you think?  That the merchant prince let me live because I spent a night in his chambers?  Pfft!  No, I haven't.~
@2352 = ~I see it now.  Well, then, let's get to it!~
@2353 = ~Then I will teach you.~
@2354 = ~No, Teri.~
@2355 = ~There's one more thing.  Whatever happens to us in the future, remember here, now.  Please?  Because I feel as though I will disappear if you stop remembering me.~
@2356 = ~I will always remember you, Teri.  Because you will be right next to me.~
@2357 = ~I promise.~
@2358 = ~What do you mean?~
@2359 = ~Never mind.  Just remember.~
@2360 = ~Come morning, we will blast this tower to the Nine Hells, and have a hell of a party, and have a hell of a life... in a good sense.  I'll start with arranging the pillows!~
@2361 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>.~
@2362 = ~Please, join my party.~
@2363 = ~I am sorry, but I cannot take you in.~
@2364 = ~I am sorry, but I still cannot take you in.~
@2365 = ~I have no time for you.~
@2366 = ~Welcome to my party, Nella.~
@2367 = ~Welcome to my party, Korin.~
@2368 = ~Welcome to my party, Teri.~
@2369 = ~Welcome to my party, Severn.~
@2370 = ~Welcome to my party, Holvir.~
@2371 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>.  I am called Nella.  I was born in Bryn Shander some twenty years ago.  When I was fifteen, I felt the call of the Tree.  I headed to Kuldahar, and there my real life started.~
@2372 = ~Together with the druids of Kuldahar, we work on protecting and nourishing these lands.  My travels led me here, and now I am ready to return home.~
@2373 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>.  I am Korin, though my name will tell you nothing.  For several years now, I have been a ranger in these parts.~
@2374 = ~The rumors of strange goings-on reached my ears, and I want to repay these people for their hospitality.  Hrothgar told me he was gathering adventurers for some important and dangerous venture, so I am here.~
@2375 = ~Hey there!  You are heading the expedition to Kuldahar, right?  Well, *my* story would fill a thousand pages, but I will give you a short version.~
@2376 = ~I am Teri, a swashbuckler and a rogue.  Back in Amn, not a single temple, palace or guildhall was safe from my daring attacks.  Every treasury was mine.  For several happy years, I evaded capture...  and then his people caught me.~
@2377 = ~He was of the merchant princes of Amn.  He would have let me hang, but my unearthly beauty seemed to soothe and mollify him, so instead of sending me to the gallows, he quietly put me on a ship heading for Icewind Dale.  Now that I am here, I might as well follow you.   Glory and gold, as they say.   End of story.~
@2378 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>.  I am Severn, and I'd love to join your party, if you allow me, but my story is frankly boring.  I was born, and at some point I decided I was born a bard.  Nobody tried to convince me to the contrary, so I became a wandering minstrel.~
@2379 = ~I wandered, wandered, and ended up here.  Not the most interesting of biographies, but there you go.~
@2380 = ~Greetings.  Hrothgar is waiting for us, but I cannot leave the table without introducing myself.  I am Holvir, a paladin of Tyr.~
@2381 = ~Hrothgar summoned me here, and I must say, it is an honor to be working for peace and goodwill of all the good folk among such distinguished companions.  My skills will be of use, I hope.~
@2382 = ~Let us go, then.~
@2383 = ~Am I to leave, then?~
@2384 = ~Yes.  Wait here.~
@2385 = ~Yes.  We will meet you in the Kuldahar tavern.~
@2386 = ~No, my mistake.  Please, stay.~
@2387 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>. You've made it to Kuldahar, I see.  I am called Nella.  I was born in Bryn Shander some twenty years ago.  When I was fifteen, I felt the call of the Tree.  I headed to Kuldahar, and there my real life started.~
@2388 = ~Together with the druids of Kuldahar, we work on protecting and nourishing these lands.  I will join you in your travels, if you need me.~
@2389 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>.  You've made it to Kuldahar, I see.~
@2390 = ~Greetings.  I am Korin, though my name will tell you nothing.  For several years now, I have been a ranger in these parts.~
@2391 = ~The rumors of strange goings-on reached my ears, and I want to repay these people for their hospitality.  If you need help on your journey, I shall be happy to lend a hand.~
@2392 = ~Greetings. It is good to see you in Kuldahar.~
@2393 = ~Hey, I saw you in Easthaven!  You're that adventurer from Hrothgar's expedition!  And I am Teri, a swashbuckler and a rogue.  Back in Amn, not a single temple, palace or guildhall was safe from my daring attacks.  Honest.~
@2394 = ~Seriously, every treasury was mine.  For several happy years, I evaded capture...  and then his people caught me.~
@2395 = ~He was of the merchant princes of Amn.  He would have let me hang, but my unearthly beauty seemed to soothe and mollify him, so instead of sending me to the gallows, he quietly put me on a ship heading for Icewind Dale.  Now that I am here, I might as well follow you.   Glory and gold, as they say.   End of story.~
@2396 = ~Hello there!  Good to see you're still alive!  So, you still need companions?~
@2397 = ~Hello there.  I heard of the tragedy in the mountains.  My condolences.~
@2398 = ~I am Severn, and I'd love to join your party, if you allow me, but my story is frankly boring.  I was born, and at some point I decided I was born a bard.  Nobody tried to convince me to the contrary, so I became a wandering minstrel.  I wandered, wandered, and ended up here.  Not the most interesting of biographies, but there you go.~
@2399 = ~I heard of the tragedy in the mountains.  My condolences.  Do you need help?  I could join your party, if you like.~
@2400 = ~Greetings, <CHARNAME>.  I know of the fate that befell Hrothgar, and I mourn with you.  I am Holvir, a paladin of Tyr.~
@2401 = ~Should you need assistance on your journey, I am ready to provide it.  Hrothgar summoned me to the Dale, and I must say, it is an honor to be working for peace and goodwill of all the good folk among such distinguished companions.  My skills will be of use, I hope.~
@2402 = ~Greetings, <CHARNAME>.  I know of the fate that befell Hrothgar, and I mourn with you.~
@2403 = ~I can no longer be a part of this.~ [o#blank]
@2404 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>.  I am glad to see a familiar face.  Are you still searching for adventure?  I will join you, if you need me.~
@2405 = ~Already found it.  Come along.~
@2406 = ~Good to see you again.  Do you need help on your travels?~
@2407 = ~Of course, Korin.  Come, adventure awaits.~
@2408 = ~<CHARNAME>!  Oh, it is good to see you!~
@2409 = ~Good to see you, too, Teri.  Join me.~
@2410 = ~Do my eyes deceive me?  <CHARNAME> the Magnificent, in the flesh!  Would you like a song or two on your journey?~
@2411 = ~Maybe.  Come with me, Severn.~
@2412 = ~Greetings, my friend.  Have you heard of the plight that befell the barbarian tribes?  A war is about to break, and I am concerned about the cause.~
@2413 = ~We will get to the bottom of this, Holvir.  Together.~
@2414 = ~I am a lady of many mysteries, but for now, my name will do.  It is <CHARNAME>.~
@2415 = ~I have seen some battles and journeyed some roads, and now my road has brought me here, to Easthaven.  I am <CHARNAME>, friends.  Good to meet you all.~
@2416 = ~It is a pleasure indeed to meet you all. I hope we will know more about each other on the road.~
@2417 = ~'That rotten performance'?  A tale about your past, Severn?  Now I'm intrigued.~
@2418 = ~Don't tell me.  I think my breakfast is about to run away and hide somewhere under a blanket.~
@2419 = ~Not at all, Holvir.  You are my friend and companion, my steadfast ally, my advisor.  That's what matters most to me.~
@2420 = ~Maybe.  I like teasing you a little about it, sometimes.  And I like the way you're self-conscious about it.~
@2421 = ~It is time.  And... thank you all for being here with me.  Our strength is in our camraderie, our hearts and our close friendship.~
@2422 = ~And you are a fine, fine friend.~
@2423 = ~Let's take a deep breath, first.  My head is still sore.~
@2424 = ~We'll save Easthaven, and that madman will not escape.  Follow me!~
@2425 = ~That's it.  Now that bastard made me seriously angry, and I'm going to kick his sick ass all the way to the Abyss and beyond.  Who is with me?~
@2426 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. Tell me if you need any healing.~
@2427 = ~Just about everyone, I'd say! Let's do it!~
@2428 = ~And I know my future: we are going to win this battle.  And I will be happy if our little company remains together: there are still new roads to walk and new enemies to defeat.  Besides, it's been such fun!~
@2429 = ~Our last conversation before the big battle...  My friends, it has been my joy, my honor to travel with you.  This has truly been a good adventure.~
@2430 = ~Just know this: I love you all.  And if we part, I am going to miss you terribly.  But I hope that some day we'll travel together again - or just share a drink here, on the shores of Lac Dinneshere.~
@2431 = ~You're a great friend, <CHARNAME>.  Probably the reason we're still breathing, too.  And if, after all is said and done, we remain together for a while to make Icewind Dale a better place - I am all for it!~
@2432 = ~So... the final battle, anyone?  The mirror?  The, you know, villain?  Unless you've all forgotten?~
@2433 = ~Seems like trouble.  Why don't we run away?~
@2434 = ~And leave Kuldahar to its fate?  Nay, my friend, you jest, but your heart is brave - and it would never stand for such a thing.~
@2435 = ~We are going to save everyone and then some.  Maybe not today, or not tomorrow.  But we will fight and we will win.~
@2436 = ~It must have been horrible.  Holvir, I am your friend.  If you wish to talk to me about this, I am ready to listen.~
@2437 = ~(Place your hand on Holvir's shoulder silently)~
@2438 = ~I'd have been horrified.  And you were only a child...  No one should suffer like this.~
@2439 = ~I am with you, Holvir.  Imagine I am by your side: take my hand and continue.~
@2440 = ~True.  Your words hold more truth than you know.~
@2441 = ~(Holvir's hand slides into yours.  His fingers are soft and warm, but his face is pained, distant.)~
@2442 = ~I can just imagine.  Some events shape us, Holvir.  Make us what we are.  I regret you had to go through this, but perhaps you became a better man in the end.~
@2443 = ~I know it was hard.  But whenever you wish to talk - about this or anything else - just tell me.  I am here for you.~
@2444 = ~Myself?  Perhaps.  But those who suffered, burned, died? I do not know...  But in my heart, I feel I am still repaying the debt to a young boy who lost his innocence in Waterdeep fifteen years ago.~
@2445 = ~Thank you.  It matters to me.  It does.  But in my heart, I feel I am still repaying the debt to a young boy who lost his innocence in Waterdeep fifteen years ago.~
@2446 = ~Because they are in pain.  They've never been loved, never had someone who cared for them, never felt empathy.  Can they change?~
@2447 = ~Tyr willing, some day it will be done.  An orc paladin fighting beside a kobold shaman to protect innocents... a strange vision, perhaps.  But I pray it becomes true.~
@2448 = ~We are making our own sacrifices, Holvir.  Fighting and bleeding side by side, risking our lives.  It may not be glorious, but I think we are doing our best, aren't we?~
@2449 = ~I hope so.  Although there is something like pride in these words.  I should strive to avoid this emotion, I should think - it leads down a very dangerous path for such as you and me.~
@2450 = ~Oooh!  Definitely!  How about we escape from the others and do something naughty?~
@2451 = ~<CHARNAME>...  I appreciate your humor, but it is not what I have had in mind.  I, ahem...  Actually, I wanted to talk to you about these books.~
@2452 = ~I like dreaming as I read.  Imagining myself in the heroine's stead.  Sometimes I like to dream of you.~
@2453 = ~You do?  I... I am flattered.  Honored, too, in no small way.~
@2454 = ~Once this adventure is over, we can return here together.  And read every book in this library, page by page.~
@2455 = ~I would like that.  These books and your company - it will be a wonderful adventure of its own.~
@2456 = ~Heroing, naturally!  Saving the world, slaying some big neer-do-well, or just doing lots and lots of good stuff in general.  Come on, Holvir, we're pretty much Champions of Kuldahar already!~
@2457 = ~Much as I want you to be more serious sometimes, you may be correct about that.~
@2458 = ~I am also determined to kiss you.  I wonder, is there a title for really, really wanting to kiss a handsome and serious paladin?~
@2459 = ~Ah...  Not that I've heard of...~
@2460 = ~Good! So the title will be mine some day!~
@2461 = ~(Kiss him on the lips quickly)~
@2462 = ~(Kiss him on the cheek)~
@2463 = ~(cough) I... admire your dedication.~
@2464 = ~(His lips are warm and dry, and his mouth opens in surprise... but he quickly remembers himself and steps back with a bow.) <CHARNAME>, I am not used to...  I am not sure we should make such displays in front of everyone.~
@2465 = ~But I-I admire your dedication... and any title you desire is most definitely yours.~
@2466 = ~(Holvir's face pinks in a rather becoming manner.)~
@2467 = ~You are too kind. And I... I value it.~
@2468 = ~It must surely seem boring to you, to play the role of a strict, a little pompous by-the-rules paladin when you are obviously so much more.~
@2469 = ~Yes, but...~
@2470 = ~Remember, you always have friends.  And if you are cold and afraid - we are here.~
@2471 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.  I will remember your words.~
@2472 = ~But come.  We've much to do, and time grows short.~
@2473 = ~I have come to care for you, <CHARNAME>.  Very much so.  But you probably know it already.~
@2474 = ~Finally!  You love me-love me-love me - YES!  And, hey, I like you, too.~
@2475 = ~That's pretty damn disappointing.  I mean, you're handsome, well-built, tall... and pretty much amazing.  I want to do all these things with you!  And now it turns out I cannot?  But I love you.  And, hey, maybe I'll corrupt you down the road... or we'll figure something out.~
@2476 = ~I wouldn't be too optimistic, <CHARNAME>.  What I told you is really the truth, I'm afraid.  But I love you - and this is truth, too.~
@2477 = ~It's a nice little place, but I'd go mad within a month.  What kept you here all these years?~
@2478 = ~Many things.  My own pride, my own conscience... but we can speak of it at a later time.  For now, a simple answer will suffice: I like the place and its people.~
@2479 = ~I like peace and quiet, myself.  But let's hope that our journey will prove to be a good thing for you.~
@2480 = ~Thank you.  You make me feel welcome, <CHARNAME> - I appreciate it.  I do.  It is just...~
@2481 = ~That sounds pretty horrible.  I feel for you - and I am amazed you survived.  It shows a strength of character.~
@2482 = ~Gods!  I would have died on the spot.~
@2483 = ~I am amazed myself, looking back at the day now.  Back then, though, I simply didn't have a single thought in my head.~
@2484 = ~You were too proud to tell anyone at the Academy, were you?  I might have done the same in your shoes.~
@2485 = ~Thank you for this confession.  If it helps, I am here for you.~
@2486 = ~Thank you, but... to be truthful, I doubt anything can help me now.~
@2487 = ~It is, isn't it?  Doing something worthwhile.  Making something of our lives.  You know, one day I'll look back on our time in these tombs and smile.~
@2488 = ~It is a worthy task indeed.  Just... unexpected.~
@2489 = ~And I'm enjoying to have you here with us.  You no longer have to be alone, you know.~
@2490 = ~Hold on, Korin.  Just keep holding on: we shouldn't lose our minds now, with monsters around.~
@2491 = ~I know.  But I cannot think of anything else.  Seldarine, I do not see anything else - only his body, his dead face, his... (groan)  And I never even properly talked to him in Easthaven.~
@2492 = ~More or less.  He was your kinsman, I understand, but he was a friendly face to me, too.  I wish there was anything we could have done.~
@2493 = ~It looks pretty, though.  Pretty, sturdy, very light.  I like it!~
@2494 = ~It's just an item, Korin.  Perhaps we'll sell it, or perhaps not, but what's more important is your love for your goddess, your memories.  No one ever will take those from you, not even dark enchanters who created this mail.~
@2495 = ~I wouldn't be so sure.  My magic is already gone; what's next?~
@2496 = ~I'm broken after Arundel's death.  I've grown used to him, considered him a friend, and he died for us...  It is so sad, so unfair.~
@2497 = ~You are describing my feelings.  If only we could've done something...~
@2498 = ~I do not know.  But I know we'll do everything to stop the destruction of Kuldahar.  And you, Korin, will do everything to avenge Arundel, not to become his murderer.~
@2499 = ~Korin, stop punishing yourself.  You are not at fault for what happened here!~
@2500 = ~I understand, and I feel for you, Korin.  I want you to find peace.~
@2501 = ~And I think you've made a right choice, my friend: to strive to be better, to respect goodness and sacrifice.~
@2502 = ~For what it's worth, I knew you'd choose wisely.~
@2503 = ~Very nice.  I wish I could study here... or in any place like this, really.~
@2504 = ~I would like to see Evereska by your side, too, you know.  Will you take me with you?~
@2505 = ~Gladly, if they let us both in.  But if we do become the heroes of Icewind Dale, I do not see why not.  I'd gladly show you Evereska - if we make it out alive.~
@2506 = ~They are idiots, pure and simple.  But evil never wins, Korin.~
@2507 = ~I do love it when you speak passionately.  Alas, I keep hoping you'd kiss me, but it never happens.~
@2508 = ~I may surprise you one day.~
@2509 = ~I am glad to see you care.  I could get used to it, you know.~
@2510 = ~I will keep it in mind, then.  And I am glad that you are glad... (sigh) Awkward, I see.  Never mind.~
@2511 = ~I'd like it to be by your side, for some strange reason.  But I do not know what will happen.~
@2512 = ~Neither do I.  But your company is a dream, <CHARNAME>.  You and I, together, on the road - or somewhere else...  I would like that very much.~
@2513 = ~Shall we sit together and dream a little more?~
@2514 = ~I would love to know, too, if only for your sake.  And maybe we will.~
@2515 = ~Finally!  Of course I love you, you idiot!  From the day we looked at each other in Kuldahar... or earlier, in Easthaven.  But I love you, Korin.  I love you.~
@2516 = ~Do you think I care?  We are going to nail his ass either way.  And you, dear, are going to be right by my side.~
@2517 = ~Naturally.  He'll regret he ever set foot in Easthaven.~
@2518 = ~I'll never risk leaving you.  Ever.~
@2519 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>.  Melamin, my love... I am tempted to say so many words to you, but we have people to rescue and...  Just know that I think of you every minute of every hour.~
@2520 = ~And I am going to leave you exhausted on that ranger cot of yours, you have my word.~
@2521 = ~Promises, promises.  I will remember this one.~
@2522 = ~Of course.  Kuldahar is such a cosy small hamlet.  I understand why you love the place - and its people.~
@2523 = ~And some of them may be dying as we speak.  My heart is in great disquiet.~
@2524 = ~Unfortunately, great magic attracts various idiots.  Demons, dragons, cultists, bandits...  Fortunately, there are always heroes like us.  And you know what?  We usually win.~
@2525 = ~Trust me, I am with you on this.  Don't worry, I know you are a good woman, Nella.~
@2526 = ~You would make a fine leader, Nella.  A beautiful heroine.  I'd like you to stay by my side.~
@2527 = ~Truly?  I may have to remember these words.  But do not say them again if you mean only idle flattery; it wouldn't be right.~
@2528 = ~I want to help you.  Let's talk about Arundel, and maybe you'll feel better.~
@2529 = ~I cannot believe it.  You are fearless.~
@2530 = ~You are a treasured friend, Nella.  And I'll always be here for you.~
@2531 = ~I'm very happy to hear you're staying.  I can't imagine what we'd do without you.  Me, I'd miss you very much.~
@2532 = ~We know very little of our enemies.  But I sometimes wish to learn more.  The drow, for once - so many legends and dark tales are about them...~
@2533 = ~Nella!  I thought the moment would never come!  Of course, I love you: I always cared for you, admired your beauty, your strength...~
@2534 = ~I'd find some flowers and cook you a romantic dinner, but it may have to wait until the end of our small crusade.~
@2535 = ~A beautiful thought.  It is a pity that summers are so short here.~
@2536 = ~As long as we stay together, we can plan all the details later.  And I want to see the world with you, too.~
@2537 = ~And, naturally, it turned out to be a trap.~
@2538 = ~I am really, really sorry.  I swear, if I were there, I'd give them a sound beating!~
@2539 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.  Not that we have a time machine or anything, but... it is good to hear.~
@2540 = ~Well, it's good to have someone next to you who is just as disappointed at the end of the day.  Good to share the blame, too.~
@2541 = ~It is, isn't it?  Although you do have to split the booty.~
@2542 = ~Then we might actually lose.  And die.~
@2543 = ~Which would be bad: no loot, no girls, no place to call my own.  Then again, we wouldn't have to walk all the way to Kuldahar.  Which reminds me: shall we go?~
@2544 = ~I wish we could find some ancient ritual, too.  Or petition a god.  They are not evil, just... lost.~
@2545 = ~They are, aren't they?  It's a terrible feeling... I never expected any of this.~
@2546 = ~I wish I had brothers like yours.  They sound like great friends to have.~
@2547 = ~Yes, well... if only they didn't keep teasing me about it mercilessly for months afterwards.  Alas, I was not so lucky.~
@2548 = ~And a pie!  A pie is good.~
@2549 = ~Absolutely!  I call first dibs on the crust, though.  The crunchy bits are my specialty.~
@2550 = ~Severn, if you really are hoping for a real answer, you'd have to listen to me for hours!  Can you really sum yourself up in a few words?~
@2551 = ~You're supposed to be looking for answers and only finding more questions.  You're a bard, remember?  And an adventurer.  A road of self-discovery and all that.~
@2552 = ~It's absolutely monstrous and terrible.  I can't see a reason, either, I just want to stop it.~
@2553 = ~And thank you, my dear friend.  I love you to bits, too, you know.~
@2554 = ~Thank you, Severn.  We are truly comrades-in-arms now.  And if you ever need help, I will always come to your call.~
@2555 = ~Just like that?  I like your approach.  Fast and practical.~
@2556 = ~I'm surprised they didn't kill you outright.~
@2557 = ~Fascinating.  He spent quite a lot to ensure you were captured and brought before him, didn't he?  Probably wanted to get alone with you, too?~
@2558 = ~Most likely.  You know how it is with us adventurers: we just keep following leads, until finally, the coveted artifact is in our hands.~
@2559 = ~We can always keep it, and use it in a year or so, when someone from our party finally learns some worthy divination spells.~
@2560 = ~I do, and I finally feel veeeery suspicious...~
@2561 = ~I like the way you think!  Just you and me, absolutely.~
@2562 = ~It depends on my mood, I suppose.  I can't say happiness is the first thing on my mind, though, not in this place.~
@2563 = ~I don't, either.  Come on, Teri, we're adventurers, vagabonds, brilliant scoundrels and noble heroes - we go where the road guides us.  Why worry so much?~
@2564 = ~I thought we've established this fact long ago, Teri.  Of course we have.~
@2565 = ~You know, sometimes I'm seriously thinking you're flirting with me.~
@2566 = ~Ha!  Keeping you on your toes, am I?  I like you a lot, like a sister.  I like teasing you, too.  But right now, I really, really need another warm tunic.  My back is freezing.~
@2567 = ~You know, if you're falling in love with a certain bard and need advice, I am here for you.~
@2568 = ~You're sweet to offer, but I'm probably more shy than I let on.  No, but I've been thinking: if there's something I'm in love with, it's this journey.~
@2569 = ~You silly, brilliant, wonderful little rogue, of course I love you!  I'd have kissed you, swept you off your feet and stolen you to some cosy cave ages ago, if I could.~
@2570 = ~It takes more than some blasts and teleportation spells to really hurt me.  As long as you're fine, I'm fine.~
@2571 = ~What do you mean, must be?  It absolutely, surely, and irreversibly is love of the highest order!  Come here, you.~
@2572 = ~Mmmmph!  <CHARNAME>, stop kissing me, I'm still talking!~
@2573 = ~Nothing would please me more.  You are beautiful, Teri, beautiful beyond words.  And I want to show you how much I love you.~
@2574 = ~Then it's a wonderful gift, Teri.  We'll try not to squander it.  Let's wait for the right time.~
@2575 = ~I am truly honored then.  So... tonight is the night.  I'd very much like to make love to you, Teri.~
@2576 = ~You will never disappear, love.  We'll survive and live long, exciting, and absolutely breathtaking lives.  There might even be statues.~
