@53   = ~(Holvir leans forward and kisses you on the forehead.)~
@54   = ~Tyr requires much of His faithful, but there is no higher honor than to serve Him.  To keep Tyr's favor, one must keep one's actions just and honorable, respect fallen enemies and friends alike, and tirelessly pursue and slay agents of evil.~

@56   = ~Tyr's church is my natural home.  The priests are known for never refusing aid to the faithful, when they are in distress.  It is a blessing to know I shall always be welcome there, as long as I am on the right path.~
@57   = ~Tyr is the leader of the Triad, a trio of gods devoted to the concepts of duty, honor, courage, justice and sacrifice.  The other two are Ilmater, the Crying God, and Torm the True, the Brave.  I revere them all, though it is first and foremost the Just God whom I serve.~
@58   = ~It means to be endlessly crusading in the name of order and good, against the darker tides of this world.~
@59   = ~A paladin follows his personal code of conduct, always.  He must remain truthful and forthright at all times, he must defend and obey his Church and his Order, and protect those who entrusted their life and safety to him, as I swore to protect my companions.~

@80   = ~(He clasps your hand, smiles, and returns to his place in formation.)~
@81   = ~Of course I am.  When my mentor died, I felt much the same.~

@87   = ~Nothing.  Just asking.~

@89   = ~My father is a retired officer of the guard; my mother a priestess of Selune.  We had a quiet, sheltered home... but you know what happened next.~
@90   = ~After the fire, my mother had a crisis of faith.  I suspect she's given some of her zeal to me through some unknown means, for I stumbled upon the temple of Tyr soon after, and for the next year, I scarcely left it.~
@91   = ~Still, I have a comfortable home and loving parents.  Not many do.~
@92   = ~It is tragic.  I feel the Order should do more in these lands, stretch out a hand to all those who'd take it.  Peace and prosperity cannot be brought on the edge of the sword, but if my sword can ensure protection of those who are outnumbered and helpless, it will.~
@93   = ~I am quite sure I feel the same way, <CHARNAME>.  It is my pleasure.~
@94   = ~So we have.  Dorn's Deep, the Hand, Dragon's Eye, vast caves and buildings of ice...~

@105  = ~I am deeply honored.  If only we were free to do as we liked, I would ask you for your hand in marriage in an instant.  But you do remember what I said about serving Tyr, do you not?  I pledged myself already, and I will remain faithful to this promise to my Church for as long as I live.~

@149  = ~(He takes your hand under the cloak, and looks into your eyes for a long time.)~
@150  = ~(His hand is hardly any bigger than yours, and his palms are cold.  But they warm up under your touch soon enough.)~
@151  = ~(Korin clasps your hand and brings it to his lips, his expression so serious that it is almost comical.  He smiles at you with his eyes, and lets go.)~
@152  = ~(You proceed side by side, your hand in his.)~
@153  = ~Togetherness, if we and the fates allow it.  Peace, if not.  Risk, I am sure.  Danger, almost certainly.  But not loneliness.~
@154  = ~I do not care, much, as long as I have you with me.  But I would dearly like to visit Evereska again.~
@155  = ~Happiness, I would like to hope.~
@156  = ~*Our* future.  It sounds so strange and wondrous, doesn't it?~
@157  = ~There is precious little to tell.  I was born and raised in Evereska; my mother was a... talented mage; so was my father.  I studied in the Academy for a while... no, I am in no mood for this.  Another time.~
@158  = ~I think I have been happiest in my hut near Easthaven.  Clear water, snow, squirrels - what else could I wish for?  Peace and quiet, and some food for thought, perhaps; and I had all.~
@159  = ~I used to worship Hanali Celanil fervently in my youth.  Not that it ever went anywhere, in any, ah, meaning of the word.  But that is neither here nor there.~
@160  = ~It will take either too much time, or none at all.  Besides, I know nearly nothing of you.~
@161  = ~I was tired of silence, mainly.  Self-sufficient as I am, I would like to have someone to talk to once in a while.  Or someones.~
@162  = ~Hrothgar asked me, and I could not refuse, after everything he and his men did for me.  Besides, I have some experience in tracking bandits and goblins; I may be of use.~

@164  = ~I want to find myself.  Don't we all?~
@165  = ~It is hard, but I manage.  I feel the loss, and I am depressed at times, but it passes.  Besides, I am here to do what I must, not to keep reminiscing.~
@166  = ~It often scares me, mostly because I do not understand why and how it happened.  Who did this to me?  What if I lose something else?  Fear is a strong emotion, <CHARNAME>.~
@167  = ~It is difficult to explain.  There are days when I do not think of it at all.  Then I wake up, try to conjure a light, and... and remember.  These are the worst moments of my life.~
@168  = ~Just as anyone does after losing someone dear: I grieve, and I try to come to terms with it.  Before we left Easthaven, I thought I already had.~
@169  = ~It would be more suspicious if I were full of someone else, don't you think?~
@170  = ~I shall do my best to humble myself, but I warn you, so far I have failed miserably.~
@171  = ~Am I?  I think I have simply been lonely for a long time, and there are things that weigh on my mind; I long to share them with a friend.  But I shall try not to disturb you more often than necessary.~
@172  = ~I am sorry if my conduct offended you, <CHARNAME>.~
@173  = ~Thank you.  You are quite a charming leader yourself.~
@174  = ~We are thinking along the same lines.~
@175  = ~Your good graces and your friendship matter a great deal to me.  Thank you.~
@176  = ~I appreciate the sentiment.  I, too... ahem.  I, too, like you.~
@177  = ~Of... of course.  I will honor your wish the best I can, and you will always have my friendship.~
@178  = ~Because you could reply that you do not love me like I love you, and never will.~
@179  = ~Yes, we may have had more time, but we have time, here, now and forevermore.  We are together.~
@180  = ~Oh, very much so.  I would be uneasy if... no, nothing.~
@181  = ~I am not the most conscientious person in the world, or indeed in this group, but I detest brutality.  Just that.~
@182  = ~But it is a huge pleasure to be among people again.  I have been alone for a long time; I never imagined.~
@183  = ~It's the calm before the storm.  And the storm will not be long in coming.~
@184  = ~Frankly, I hate not being in the know.  I wish we knew the name of our enemy; don't you?~
@185  = ~I do.~
@186  = ~We will soon enough.~
@187  = ~What does it matter?  He will die regardless.~
@188  = ~I do not like uncertainty.  In these moments, I wish it were all over, one way or the other.~
@189  = ~These nights?  A comfortable bed, mostly.~
@190  = ~Oh, it is.  I never thought I'd ache for loneliness again, but bathing in company is the limit.  Present company excluded, of course.~
@191  = ~On the other hand, there is a very real, and very cold loneliness - for Larrel and my people in Severed Hand.  When I think of them, I do not have the heart to complain.~
@192  = ~Why would you ask?  No, I don't think...~
@193  = ~It's not important.  But since you asked, it must be for you, so I will answer.~
@194  = ~I am not sure I can love.  Lust - certainly, and passion, too, of a sort.  But I am still splintered.  I must find balance.~
@195  = ~Wary.  A little afraid.  More confident and relaxed.  It's a conflicting swirl of emotions: I cannot tell which prevails.~
@196  = ~What of you?~
@197  = ~I am glad.  I welcome it.~
@198  = ~Skill is always a good thing.~
@199  = ~I am confident in my destiny.~
@200  = ~I am not sure.~
@201  = ~No, tell me more of yourself.~
@202  = ~I have just realized: as a mage, I've been powerful, but not as powerful as I am now, as a ranger.  Curious, and so ironic...~
@203  = ~And you cannot?~
@204  = ~No.~
@205  = ~I wish I could.~
@206  = ~Sometimes, perhaps.~
@207  = ~(Korin smiles and presses your hand.)~
@208  = ~They are often of you.~
@209  = ~My head spins sometimes, and I ache for the sky.  But it is nothing; nothing.  Thank you for asking.~
@210  = ~(Korin looks at you in surprise.  His expression softens, and he puts his free arm around you, whispering something in Elven tongue.)~
@211  = ~Thank you.  These words mean a lot, coming from you.  If not for your cool head, I would not be standing here right now.~
@212  = ~She was not completely in the wrong, I think.  But between her life and ours, between Lonelywood's safety and her mad plans... we did the right thing.~
@213  = ~What is it, <CHARNAME>?~
@214  = ~(Smile at her)~
@215  = ~(Nod at her)~
@216  = ~You are very beautiful.~
@217  = ~(Kiss her cheek)~

@227  = ~Do you know many people in Kuldahar?~
@228  = ~I just want to tell you that I am here for you, and that I, too, mourn for your loss.~
@229  = ~Nella... I wish I could help.~
@230  = ~I think I may have feelings for you.~
@231  = ~I prefer outdoors to indoors; don't you?~
@232  = ~I admire you.~
@233  = ~The end is close.  Do you feel it?~
@234  = ~You are very special to me.  I do not want to lose you.~
@235  = ~Lonelywood, Burial Isle, Gloomfrost... It was a good adventure.~
@236  = ~Nella, I would like us to remain friends, nothing more.~
@237  = ~I am well, thank you.  I am worried about the Great Tree, though.  Kuldahar is the Tree; if the Great Oak falls, so do we.~
@238  = ~Better than ever.  It is good to be on the road again.~
@239  = ~I have been thinking on Kuldahar's plight, and I still wonder who is responsible for it.  Don't you?~
@240  = ~I would like to talk to Arundel again soon.  I miss him.~
@241  = ~(She smiles politely.)~
@242  = ~(Her smile is hesitant and slow, but genuine.)~
@243  = ~(She raises an eyebrow, but smiles back.)~

@248  = ~(Nella nods back.)~
@249  = ~Why... thank you.~
@250  = ~I have been told this before.  But not by you.~
@251  = ~You are flattering me, <CHARNAME>.  Why would you do that?~
@252  = ~(She coughs, colors and turns away.)~
@253  = ~(Her skin is cool, soft, and smelling of fresh water and flowers.)~
@254  = ~(She smiles, and before you can react, she quickly kisses you on the lips.)~
@255  = ~(As you withdraw, you hear a small sigh.)~
@256  = ~(She chuckles and promptly kisses you on the cheek in turn.)~
@257  = ~(Nella returns your embrace, but lets go very quickly.)~
@258  = ~(Nella puts her hands on your shoulders and looks straight into your face.  Her eyes shine, her lips open... but she says nothing.)~
@259  = ~(She gracefully steps into your arms and lingers for a few moments, before slipping her own arms around you.)~
@260  = ~(She embraces you, slowly and tenderly.)~
@261  = ~(Her fingers find yours and press them.)~
@262  = ~(Nella smiles at you, and you walk hand in hand.)~

@266  = ~I know.~
@267  = ~And I... love you.~
@268  = ~You honor me, <CHARNAME>.  I am not sure I am prepared to accept it.~
@269  = ~And we are together.~
@270  = ~Let us hope we both made the right choice.~
@271  = ~It is my pleasure.  Thank you.~
@272  = ~Thank you for having me.~
@273  = ~You are welcome, <CHARNAME>.  I did not expect to find friends on my journey, but it was a pleasant revelation.~
@274  = ~Of course.~
@275  = ~It depends on which battle you are talking about.~
@276  = ~We must.  Kuldahar will not be threatened.~
@277  = ~We may.  Will we?  I do not know, but I will act as though I do.~
@278  = ~It is a beautiful place.  Long ago, it was closed and barred to all visitors, but now druids and farmers co-exist peacefully together.  Some inhabitants of the valley are merchants, explorers or travelling wizards; they do not linger for long.  But others do, and I've grown fond of some of them.~
@279  = ~It is my home.  There is little I can say of it, except that it is a warm, welcome place, and also the place where I've been happiest.~
@280  = ~When I was a young girl, Arundel was like a father to me.  A great listener and a great mentor.  Meeting him was a stroke of luck I never expected.~
@281  = ~Before long, you realize how small it is.  From the smithy to the inn, from the inn to the tavern, from the tavern to the temple, Arundel's house or the tower - five minutes, and you are on the other end of the village.  But I prefer it this way.~
@282  = ~Am I?  I never noticed.~
@283  = ~Distant, as opposed to being overly familiar?  I prefer it this way, <CHARNAME>.~
@284  = ~I have much to think about.  And we have much to do.~
@285  = ~I do not know why it seems so to you, truly.  I shall try to be more open in the future.~
@286  = ~You talk of Arundel, don't you?  There is nothing anyone can do.~
@287  = ~I will.  Thank you.~
@288  = ~Arundel... It will get better, but right now I would like to be alone for a while.  Thank you.~
@289  = ~I am fine, <CHARNAME>, fine.  I just need to be on my own sometimes.~
@290  = ~We are friends, <CHARNAME>.~
@291  = ~Because some things cannot be rushed.  Nor should they.~
@292  = ~(She leans forward, and softly kisses you.)~
@293  = ~This is my answer.~
@294  = ~My mother and father never showed any particular interest in me.  He did.  Always.~
@295  = ~Quite a few.  Everyone, I would think... only, of course, some better than the others.  I like Oswald a great deal, and the priests are always friendly.  And Arundel...~
@296  = ~Kuldahar is my home, <CHARNAME>.  The best there is.~
@297  = ~Thank you.  But I would rather be alone now.  I hope you understand.~
@298  = ~I know.  I'm holding on, <CHARNAME>.  Do not worry about me.~
@299  = ~Don't, <CHARNAME>.  I do not say "no", but... give it time.~
@300  = ~I love nature in all its guises.  But the air, the wind - nothing can compare.~
@301  = ~And I you.  You are a great leader and a great friend.  And... a great help.  Your very presence brings me comfort.~
@302  = ~Yes, soon Arundel will be avenged.  I am not going to die trying: I will strangle the bastard, even if it is the last thing I do.~
@303  = ~You understand, don't you?  He was everything to me, just like Kuldahar is.  I MUST see it through.~
@304  = ~Shh.  Don't spoil the moment.~
@305  = ~You won't.~
@306  = ~I agree.  I have discovered much about myself, and by the looks of you, it seems, so have you.~
@307  = ~And best of all, we won.  Lonelywood will know peace.~
@308  = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>.~
@309  = ~(Wink at him)~
@310  = ~(Clap Severn on the shoulder)~
@311  = ~(Whistle a tune)~
@312  = ~Where did you study magic?~
@313  = ~What is your opinion of me?~
@314  = ~Are you ever serious?~
@315  = ~Tell me more of yourself.~
@316  = ~I like you, Severn.~
@317  = ~Severn, please, leave Teri alone.~
@318  = ~You promised to buy me a dinner, remember?~
@319  = ~You look pale.  What is it?~
@320  = ~What does being an adventurer mean to you?~
@321  = ~Are you afraid of death?~
@322  = ~What do you think of our predicament?~
@323  = ~I'll miss your jokes and tales after this is over.~
@324  = ~There are so many different ways of complaining, and only a few to say "I am fine".  I am fine, <CHARNAME>.  Don't worry.~
@325  = ~Still enduring.  Bards are supposed to be good at that.~
@326  = ~I am well, and how are you?~
@327  = ~Rest would be welcome.  Then again, it's always welcome, eh?~
@328  = ~(Severn bows.)~
@329  = ~Heh.  You are in a good mood today.~
@330  = ~(Severn winks back.)~
@331  = ~What *are* you trying to tell me, <CHARNAME>?~
@332  = ~It was my shoulder.  R.I.P.~
@333  = ~(Severn claps you on the back, harder than is necessary.)~
@334  = ~Hmm?  What did I miss?~
@335  = ~Ow!  Easy here!~
@336  = ~Something familiar...  Hmm, let me guess... Would you care to repeat it again?~
@337  = ~Who would have thought you knew this one!  Haha, shame on you, <CHARNAME>!  What would the old ladies say?~
@338  = ~(In a few seconds, Severn picks up the tune, and you wind up whistling a duet.)~
@339  = ~I've never heard this one.  It's not yours, per chance?~
@340  = ~Oh, here and there.  One old mage near Beregost even said I had a natural talent, but I prefer singing.~
@341  = ~Bits and pieces added up.  My mother's brother was a scholar.  A few summers with him, and I knew enough for a novice.  He said I could carry on by myself then, and I did.~
@342  = ~I've no idea.  It's magic!~
@343  = ~I wanted to find a tutor, but I did not have the money.  So I spent a few months in a mage's tower, cooking and cleaning for him.  I hoped to be admitted as an apprentice, but what in fact happened... well, I do not want to talk about it.  Just don't trust every pointy hat you meet, that's all I can say.~
@344  = ~Why, you are a mystery, dark and deep!  But you are not a bad person.  Otherwise, why would you have helped this bard?~
@345  = ~I think we'll get along just fine.  We already do.~
@346  = ~I like you.  I'd say "I could not wish for a better leader", but since you are expecting *something* of me, and theoretically, there's always someone out there who would expect *nothing*... ah, just noticed your look.  Shutting up now.~
@347  = ~I would like to think of you as my friend.  Or a future friend?  Well, as long as it's not a "former friend".~
@348  = ~Now that you've kindly reminded me, why, I am.  Shall we discuss my share of the profits?~
@349  = ~Sometimes.  Mostly when I am sad, or when I've lost something... or someone.~
@350  = ~You wouldn't like me when I'm serious.  Seriously.~
@351  = ~I do not know...  I must be?  Hmm, interesting question.  I must seriously think on it.~
@352  = ~Well, I was raised on a farm.  I think I told you that.  I have several brothers, a kind mother who is also a terrific cook, and a few friends... but they've probably forgotten who I am by now.~
@353  = ~Nobody expected me to stay, I guess.  I had to find my own fortune, and I have.  Or am I still looking?~
@354  = ~I spent the best part of the last year wandering the Sword Coast, singing, performing odd plays and odd jobs, meeting new people, some of them very briefly.  I won't mention rotten vegetables here, if you do not mind.  Then, after an especially abysmal performance, I decided to change scenery, hence my journey to the Dale.~
@355  = ~Well, I've a restless adventuring spirit.  That is, I don't know what to do with my life.  Dying isn't in my immediate plans, however.  I hope you'll remember that.~
@356  = ~My father died of a heart attack four years ago.  He wasn't a hero, but I miss him all the same; I couldn't stay at home after he was gone.  Not the best or the happiest start of a career, but there you go.~
@357  = ~Oh.  Well, I like you, too.  You are a good friend and a great leader.  We are still alive, aren't we?~
@358  = ~(He risks a glance at Teri and visibly colors.)~
@359  = ~Would you have left her alone in my place?  You *are* in my place, and she is unsure - will you leave her alone now?~
@360  = ~I am sorry.  You are my friend, <CHARNAME>, but do not ask for the impossible.~
@361  = ~Sure thing!  Finally, a meal where I'll be able to tell fish from chicken!  Not that I'm trying to diminish your culinary talents in any way, of course.  Wouldn't dream of it.~
@362  = ~I'm just a little... uneasy.  Never mind me; I'll be all right in no time, as soon as we get out of here... oh, did I say the last bit aloud?  Damn.~
@363  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>: I am probably just being green.  In every sense, too.~
@364  = ~Money, fame, experience, inspiration, all of the above.  Did I mention all of the above?~
@365  = ~Seriously, I'd like to be thought of as a hero.  But I want to make a good tale even more.  And to be a part of this tale... well, one can dream.~
@366  = ~Me?  I am going to live forever, don't you know.  Oh, and you, too.  In memory.  While we are being talked about, we live.  I know, I know, it's too banal for everyone's taste, but it works.  Promise.~
@367  = ~Hmm.  We're doomed?  It goes well?  We are going to tear 'em apart?  Take your pick.~
@368  = ~I personally think it's going to be all right, IF somebody, let's not point fingers, goes easy on the party's supply of dried fruit.  But I never said anything.~
@369  = ~How now, are you going somewhere?  I thought we'd travel together for years and years... er, for several more months at least.  No?~
@370  = ~Yes, why not?~
@371  = ~I thought you'd like to leave.~
@372  = ~Don't you want to return to Baldur's Gate?~
@373  = ~Of course.  But after that?~
@374  = ~I do not like to talk of the future.  "What if... ?" becomes a very sad "What if... ?" when colored by an untimely death.~
@375  = ~But I'm too serious even for MY liking, let alone yours.  Let's sing, instead.  "In a kingdom far away..."~
@376  = ~Hey there.~
@377  = ~(Kiss her)~
@378  = ~You look beautiful.~
@379  = ~(Embrace her)~
@380  = ~(Put an arm around her shoulders)~
@381  = ~What are you thinking of?~
@382  = ~You are a valuable member of the group.~
@383  = ~Could you be a little less annoying?~
@384  = ~I would like to know more of your past.~
@385  = ~Behold, adventure!~
@386  = ~We've done well so far, don't you think?~
@387  = ~I like your sense of humor.~
@388  = ~Are you all right?  You look like you've been through the mill.~
@389  = ~What is going on between you and Severn?~
@390  = ~What do you think of the villain we are following?~
@391  = ~You are very pretty.  Has anyone told you how pretty you are?~
@392  = ~What are your plans for the future?~
@393  = ~You are much more than just a friend.~
@394  = ~We showed them all!  How we whacked that dragon, eh?~
@395  = ~Teri, I would like us to remain friends, nothing more.~
@396  = ~I think I am going to kill something soon.  Whether I want to or not; this wish always comes true.  Other than that, I am fine.~
@397  = ~Not bad.  These earrings do match my eyes, don't they?  And, incidentally, the pommel gem.~
@398  = ~I am alive, and it counts for something.  You'll try and make it last, won't you?~
@399  = ~Hmm?  Well enough.  Thank you for asking.~
@400  = ~(Teri winks at you.)~
@401  = ~(She flashes a wide smile before turning away.)~
@402  = ~(She grins and claps you on the shoulder.)~
@403  = ~(Teri smiles back.)~
@404  = ~(Teri straightens up with a snap and gives you a mock salute.)~
@405  = ~(She tilts her head, regarding you for a few moments, then nods thoughtfully.)~
@406  = ~(Teri ignores you entirely.)~
@407  = ~(Teri gives you a serious, affirmative nod... and breaks out giggling.)~
@408  = ~(Teri eagerly responds, turning the kiss into a contest.  You could swear that as your lips parted, she squealed in delight.)~
@409  = ~(She carelessly pecks you on the lips and grins at your expression.)~
@410  = ~(Teri kisses you back with a blissful smile.)~
@411  = ~Mmm... more!~
@412  = ~Slime and grime are the best friends of every adventurer!~
@413  = ~Why, thank you.  Does it mean I get a bigger share of the loot now?~
@414  = ~It is good to know we agree on something.~
@415  = ~This is my cue to smile mysteriously.~
@416  = ~(Teri immediately curls next to you and refuses to let go for the next several minutes, snapping and biting your fingers when you try to move.)~
@417  = ~(She nestles into your arms with a contented sigh.)~
@418  = ~(Teri embraces you with a smile.)~
@419  = ~(Teri literally jumps into your arms, nearly knocking you off-balance.)~
@420  = ~(She squeezes your palm before letting go.)~
@421  = ~(Teri's hand is small and warm in yours.)~
@422  = ~(As her hand slides into yours, Teri looks up and smiles.)~
@423  = ~(You walk hand in hand for a while.)~
@424  = ~(Teri grins and moves closer.)~
@425  = ~(Teri does not need to be asked twice.  With a happy squeal, she dives under your cloak and embraces you around the waist.)~
@426  = ~(Teri snorts, shrugs off your arm and puts an arm around your shoulders.  She refuses to let go for nearly a minute.)~
@427  = ~(She puts her head on your shoulder, and you see her smiling quietly.)~
@428  = ~Rocks.  One rock, two rocks, three rocks...~
@429  = ~A good meal, in company, and a good bath, alone.  Tons of warm water, too.~
@430  = ~I wonder where my parents are now.  They must be thinking of me, too.  Funny: I didn't think of them as often when we travelled together.~
@431  = ~Of you, of course.  Of our company, our quest, our goal... and my future.~
@432  = ~And of Severn, a little.~
@433  = ~Valuable?  Ha!  I am irreplaceable!~
@434  = ~Hmm.  You want something from me, don't you?~
@435  = ~Makes one wonder how you survived without me before, hm?~
@436  = ~But thank you.  Mmmm... I like compliments!~
@437  = ~How can you say such things!  You... you are wounding me!  Weep, weep... alas, woe is me, methinks.  Forsooth.~
@438  = ~Anything else?~
@439  = ~Well, I could join Ilmater's brotherhood, er, sisterhood, I suppose.  Except not.~
@440  = ~Pfft!  Absolutely not.  So there.~
@441  = ~Annoying?  Me?  You must have me confused with someone else.  Here, I'll show you this person right away - oh, here is the mirror!~
@442  = ~Let's see.  I like the sea, but I get seasick.  So my parents did not take me with them on their sea voyages.  I always rebelled against schools and private tutors, so my father, and later my mother, taught me all I know.  So, I was spending time at home, and I got bored.  I decided to strike out on my own and found myself in Amn.  The rest you know!~
@443  = ~We spent a few years in Evereska, when I was a child.  I hardly remember it now.  Ha, would you believe that I've probably been all around Faerun?  We sure travelled a lot.  It is a pity I only recall flashes of it.~
@444  = ~I am greedy and lazy, so I always wanted to become rich with little effort.  And an example was right in front of my eyes: my parents did not have to work from dawn until dusk, they did whatever they pleased, they visited fascinating places, they met interesting people, and they were never bored.  That's how I decided I wanted to be an adventurer.~
@445  = ~You know what?  Before ending up here, I'd never actually been in love.  Not even once.  Everyone gets their first love, don't they?  I wonder why I didn't.  Um, until now, I mean.~
@446  = ~Ah.~
@447  = ~Let's end this here and now, then.  I drink to new beginnings!~
@448  = ~Severn, did you hear that?~
@449  = ~He... he is in love with me.  I think.~
@450  = ~I care about him a great deal, too.  I think I would even allow him to grow closer to me, only... only there is someone else now.  And I have to know how this someone feels, first - oh, no, this is not the time.  We will talk later, <CHARNAME>, all right?~
@451  = ~Because I wasn't... I had to... oh.  <CHARNAME>, when I say that I love you, I mean that it is for life.  Not for a few months, or a few years.  It's all or nothing.~
@452  = ~And I had to be sure.~
@453  = ~Woohoo!  No mortal or undead is safe!  Hide in your tombs, skeletons!  Bolt your crypt doors, liches!  Flee, yeti!  We are coming!~
@454  = ~Pfft!  Well, if playing "How many more places should we visit, before we finally decide go to the *actual* site of the Heartstone Gem?" seems a decent way of spending time to you, sure.~
@455  = ~Ha!  And what would you have me do, tell you jokes on request?  No dice.  Either you deliver gems and flowers, or I become numb and silent.~
@456  = ~But, all right, all right, I AM pleased.  I still prefer more substantial gratitude, though.  Say, are these apples in your pack?~
@457  = ~Well, I have.  Together with you, that is.  All those poor elves, dead and not dead...~
@458  = ~(Teri abruptly turns away, and you notice she's been crying.)~
@459  = ~He is a bastard.~
@460  = ~He killed Arundel, and made Nella cry.~
@461  = ~(Teri raises an eyebrow, measures you with a cool look... and laughs.)~
@462  = ~I like you, too, <CHARNAME>.  Thank you.~
@463  = ~Travelling with you.  Why?~
@464  = ~I like it here with you.  Er, if you don't, tell me... but so far it's been swell.~
@465  = ~I know.  I am perfection personified!  Behold me, mortal sojourner, and thank Lady Tymora for your incredible, unbelievable luck!~
@466  = ~(She winks.)~
@467  = ~Yes!  Go us!  We are invincible!  Invin...~
@468  = ~Damn potholes!  Aw, my leg!  But we are still - ow! - invincible.  So there!~
@469  = ~Hey there.~
@470  = ~(Ogle Holvir shamelessly)~
@471  = ~What do you think of Icewind Dale?~
@472  = ~I am glad we have a paladin in the party to protect us.  I do feel vulnerable sometimes.~
@473  = ~Holvir, have you ever been in love?~
@474  = ~I think you like me.  No, I am positive you like me!~
@475  = ~Do you dream of leaving the Order sometimes?  Staying in one place, teaching, guarding, reading, watching your children grow?~
@476  = ~I'd like us to do something romantic together.  To sit and watch the stars at night, for example.~
@477  = ~Our journey will end soon.  Will you miss me?~
@478  = ~Was it hard to leave Waterdeep?  You've never travelled so far from home before, am I correct?~
@479  = ~Tyr is the Maimed God.  I am scared you might follow his path - literally.~
@480  = ~I often see you reading before bed.  Which book is it?~
@481  = ~How about I corrupt you?  Just a little?~
@482  = ~Some mysterious knight placed a small bouquet of forest flowers on my bedroll this morning.  Do you have any idea who it might have been?~
@483  = ~You're my touchstone, Holvir.  Always.~
@484  = ~And hello to you, <CHARNAME>.~
@485  = ~Hmm?  Did you want to tell me something?~
@486  = ~Do you need assistance?~
@487  = ~Good day and hello to you.~
@488  = ~It is brilliant.  Amazing.  But too dangerous for innocent people.  We must do something about that, <CHARNAME>.~
@489  = ~Very cold, as you imagine.  I'm almost hoping for a fight.~
@490  = ~Too many caves and caverns for my liking, but the open spaces are amazing.~
@491  = ~It is a journey in itself.  An adventure, too.~
@492  = ~(Holvir raises his eyebrows, but says nothing.)~
@493  = ~(Holvir colors visibly and falls behind you in formation.)~
@494  = ~Is there anything you'd like to tell me, <CHARNAME>?~
@495  = ~(He cuts a fine figure indeed, standing tall and proud with his sword at his back.  The wind dances in his unruly hair, and a young paladin tries to smooth them for the hundredth time... in vain, of course.  Noticing your gaze, he blinks and offers you a smile.)~
@496  = ~Just saying hello.~
@497  = ~(Laugh tantalizingly)~
@498  = ~Do you hope to become a mage again?~
@499  = ~Are you sure you didn't come to Icewind Dale because of a broken heart?  A tragic love story?~
@500  = ~Let me get this straight.  You worship Hanali, an elven goddess of love.  But you planned to become an arrogant, evil, powerful mage.  Does it even work?  Isn't Hanali about sheltering young lovers and nurturing romance, not power-grabbing and taking over the world?~
@501  = ~I am sorry you have to see a citadel of the People in such a state.  If there is anything I can do for you, anything at all, please, tell me.~
@502  = ~I've been meaning to ask.  You've spent several years alone in a hut near Easthaven, correct?  Well, what about... you know, female company?  You didn't take a vow of celibacy, did you?~
@503  = ~I was bathing the other day, and you guarded me.  How come you never even took a peek?  Or did you?~
@504  = ~We often talk as friends and companions, but I think there's still a yeti in the room.  We rarely mention our feelings for each other, do we, Korin?~
@505  = ~It must have been lonely to live on your own for years.  Or do you like solitude?~
@506  = ~You have been staring at me for the past hour, Korin.  What is it?~
@507  = ~We have been travelling together for weeks, but I still know little about you.  Would you tell me about your family?~
@508  = ~Korin, you don't have to be serious and polite all the time.  Don't you ever want to let go, laugh, enjoy yourself?~
@509  = ~I really enjoy our dinners when it's your turn to cook.  How did an arrogant mage ever acquire any kitchen skills, by the way?~
@510  = ~Don't leave me, please.  After this is over... I don't want you to go.~
@511  = ~Hello, then.~
@512  = ~Hello to you too, <CHARNAME>.~
@513  = ~A fine day, isn't it?  Minus the monsters, of course.~
@514  = ~(Korin smiles.) Hi there.~
@515  = ~I like your laugh.  It's throaty and breathtaking... Or have I imagined all that?~
@516  = ~There *must* be a story behind this.  Care to tell?~
@517  = ~(Korin slowly smiles in return, his eyes never leaving your face and throat.  He looks a touch predatory.)~
@518  = ~Who would have thought this beautiful lady will walk and laugh by my side?  I've been blessed with luck today.~
@519  = ~Magic was my life: it is impossible for me not to hope.  But it might be in vain.~
@520  = ~Perhaps.  I might start again as an apprentice, if any tutor would have me.  But it would be too humiliating... especially since my gift does not want to return.~
@521  = ~I want that, more than anything.  But some dreams aren't meant to come true.~
@522  = ~If Hanali wills it, perhaps.  You'd find a place for one more mage in your party, wouldn't you?~
@523  = ~(Admire her)~
@524  = ~(Kiss Nella on the mouth)~
@525  = ~So, before Easthaven, you've been travelling alone?  It must have been dangerous, with all these creatures around.  And lonely.~
@526  = ~I am lucky indeed to have such a beautiful healer in my party.  In case I do not say this as often as I should: thank you, Nella.  Thank you very much.~
@527  = ~I know you must be hurting right now, but you can always lean on me, Nella.  Whatever happens.~
@528  = ~I was wondering something.  Would you like to go around the world with me?~
@529  = ~Here.  Try these earrings on.  I got them for you a while ago, but the time never seemed to be just right.~
@530  = ~Do you envision settling down some day?  Having a family?  A child with your eyes?~
@531  = ~Do you miss summer?  It's way too short here in the Dale.~
@532  = ~Did you fix my cloak?  Someone darned an old hole and re-stitched a seam.~
@533  = ~You are shivering.  Let's stop for a moment, stoke a fire.~
@534  = ~Do you ever miss your parents?~
@535  = ~I watched you sleep last night.  You looked beautiful.~
@536  = ~Arundel would be proud of you.  I know it.~
@537  = ~(Nella blinks in surprise, but in the next moment she is kissing you as passionately as ever, her eyes closed in pleasure, and her heart beating rapidly.)~
@538  = ~Mmmph!  I... I want more.  Come here, you!~
@539  = ~(Nella laughs and kisses you back.)~
@540  = ~(Her lips open before you, and Nella can't help a smile at her own enthusiasm, as your kiss goes on and on, seemingly not wanting to end.)~
@541  = ~(Her hair is long and light, almost golden, and together with a pair of serious dark eyes, they create a stark contrast.  Noticing your gaze, Nella opens her mouth... but says nothing.)~
@542  = ~(Nella is a beautiful young woman, but the expression on her face is cool and calm, and she hardly ever smiles.  Even now she meets your gaze with a slight frown.)~
@543  = ~(Nella does not blush under your gaze, but turns away only too hastily just the same.)~
@544  = ~(You receive a rare smile in return.)~
@545  = ~Hey, Teri.~
@546  = ~Finally, you're mine!~
@547  = ~(Blow a kiss)~
@548  = ~So, a merchant prince chased you.  Any other wanted or unwanted suitors?~
@549  = ~I like your carefree outlook, Teri.  If not for your smile, these caves, dungeons and monsters would feel a lot more gloomy.~
@550  = ~Your parents are happily married, I've heard, and are both adventurers.  How did they meet?~
@551  = ~Hmm... strange.  For some odd reason, I have a pound of black chocolate in my backpack.  Would you care to share it with me?~
@552  = ~I can't stop dreaming of you each time I sleep.  Strange.  Do you think I'm coming down with a cold or something?~
@553  = ~We must do a romantic dinner after all of this is over.  Just the two of us.~
@554  = ~Are you all right?  You have blood in your hair.~
@555  = ~You know, I really like your nose.~
@556  = ~You always place your bedroll next to mine when we rest.  I am flattered... but why?~
@557  = ~Have you ever kissed before, Teri?  I could teach you.~
@558  = ~One day, when we finish this and sell the loot, I am going to buy you something big.  Maybe a house?~
@559  = ~Do you ever get jealous?~
@560  = ~Hey there.  Want anything?~
@561  = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>.~
@562  = ~Hi!~
@563  = ~(Teri smiles mischievously.)~
@564  = ~Am I?  Heheh.  I wouldn't be so sure just yet!~
@565  = ~Kidding.~
@566  = ~And you are MINE!  Mineminemineminemine!~
@567  = ~(Teri chuckles.)  There is only *one* certain way to find out, is there?~
@568  = ~Yep!  And you're DOOMED!~
@569  = ~(Teri blows you a kiss in return and winks.)~
@570  = ~<CHARNAME>, why does your breath smell of chocolate, and where's my share?~
@571  = ~A-ha!  So you dream of me.  Knew it!~
@572  = ~(Teri approaches you brazenly and places a sound smooch on your left cheek.  It smells faintly of cinnamon and citrus long after she's gone.)~
@573  = ~You seem quite capable yourself, lady <CHARNAME>.  Although, of course, it would be my honor.~
@574  = ~Call me old-fashioned, but it makes me feel safe, protected.~
@575  = ~Thank you, Holvir.  I appreciate it much more than you can imagine.~
@576  = ~Even so, I feel safer with you at my side.~
@577  = ~If I may ask... you are a vibrant and attractive woman.  How is it that you arrived in Easthaven alone?~
@578  = ~What do you mean, alone?  I travelled with a caravan.~
@579  = ~Without a handsome young man on my arm, you mean?~
@580  = ~I came to Icewind Dale to find new friends, Holvir.~
@581  = ~It just happened.  Currently I am alone.~
@582  = ~Sometimes young and attractive women can also be unmarried, you know.~
@583  = ~Of course.  I was simply wondering... but it is not my place.  Forgive me.~
@584  = ~Something like that.~
@585  = ~I am sorry.  I do not know why the idea even entered my head.  I simply imagined you travelling on your own, in the night, without friends and companions, and the thought was rather... disquieting.~
@586  = ~Although, naturally, as I said before, you look more than capable of defending your life and honor.~
@587  = ~I am indeed.  But thank you for your concern.~
@588  = ~Oh, I am.  But I feel much better when I can lean on someone strong.  Someone like you.~
@589  = ~Are you married yourself, by the way?  I am curious.~
@590  = ~My sword is ever at your command.~
@591  = ~No, and I likely never will be.  Life of a paladin, I'm afraid, must often be a lonely one.  But this is a conversation for another time.~
@592  = ~A curious question.  Why would you ask?~
@593  = ~Curiosity.  You said it yourself.~
@594  = ~What if I like you?~
@595  = ~We are friends, aren't we?  Or is this a painful topic?~
@596  = ~If it is idle curiosity, I am not sure we should talk about such things.  But we are indeed friends, so, perhaps...~
@597  = ~I am happy to hear it.  Indeed, travelling companions should like each other, otherwise the journey would be unbearable, wouldn't it?~
@598  = ~Hardly: there is precious little to tell.  But I appreciate your tact.~
@599  = ~I was very young when I decided to become a paladin, <CHARNAME>.  Our training is rigorous, demanding and hard.  There was precious little time to make friends or indulge in any fraternizing, and, frankly, I think our mentors wanted it this way.~
@600  = ~But once... I had a strange experience.  It was Lliira's Night, a great celebration in Waterdeep in the height of summer: the air was hot, but the nights brought some relief.  For the oddest reason, me and two other squires received invitations to Cynosure Ball, the most coveted event of the holiday.~
@601  = ~I never expected to be going there - my parents weren't noble, and although members of the clergy often get invited, squires were rarely as lucky.  Yet, there I was, dressed in finery for perhaps the first time in my life.~
@602  = ~It probably suited you, too.~
@603  = ~I wish I could see you on that night.~
@604  = ~Did you enjoy the event?~
@605  = ~I lost my fellow squires almost as soon as I stepped in.  I probably looked lost and alone among dancing pairs and drunk guests, so I doubt you would have enjoyed the sight.~
@606  = ~But someone took pity on me.  Suddenly a curtain next to me moved, and a graceful gloved hand beckoned me.  Having little choice, I stepped behind the curtain and was ushered into a small private room that had only one occupant.~
@607  = ~It was dark, so I saw little of the lady who was sitting there.  She wore a laced black dress, and a laced mask.  I guessed, rather than felt, that she was older than me - thirty-five, perhaps.~
@608  = ~Did something happen between the two of you?~
@609  = ~A mask?  How intriguing!  Was she one of the Masked Lords and Ladies?~
@610  = ~Go on, please, I'm listening.~
@611  = ~I did not know who she was, but even if I did, I certainly wouldn't want to compromise her in any way.  With a laugh, she confessed that she saw me standing alone and wanted to talk to me: out of curiosity, or pity, perhaps?  Yet she bombarded me with questions and I obliged, and before long, it felt like we were becoming fast friends.~
@612  = ~We talked through most of the night.  Very soon, or so it seemed to me then, the morning came, and the ball was over; she let me go.  As I stood up, she offered me her ungloved hand, and I kissed her fingers - only once.~
@613  = ~I never learnt her name.  Never saw her face.  Only a lock of hair... which was the same color as yours, curiously.  Your voices are alike, too - although yours is much younger.  But I am probably making things up; forgive me.~
@614  = ~After that fateful meeting, I never saw her again.  But if there is first love, and everyone experiences it at some point - she was mine.~
@615  = ~Do I look like her to you?  A reminder of your first love?~
@616  = ~A beautiful story.  Thank you for sharing it with me, Holvir.~
@617  = ~Now I feel a little jealous.~
@618  = ~You are you, <CHARNAME>.  A beautiful and unique young woman.  If there is something in you that reminds me of that lady from Lliira's night of a summer long ago, it is your genuine interest, your kindness, your strength.~
@619  = ~But there is only one of you.  And nothing compares... (cough) Never mind.  I probably said more than enough as is.~
@620  = ~I would rather not share this story with anyone else, if you would oblige me.  It is an intimate memory, after all.  But for some odd reason, it felt right to share it with you.~
@621  = ~I am quite positive I have no idea what you're talking about, <CHARNAME>.  Of course, I like you - how can I not?~
@622  = ~No, I mean *like* me like me.  Like, LIKE me!~
@623  = ~But do you really like me?~
@624  = ~I have a feeling it might be more than that.  You know, romantically.~
@625  = ~What, you don't have any feelings for me?  Oh.  My heart is broken.  Sob.  Sob!~
@626  = ~<CHARNAME>, another heart-wrenching sound, and my heart will be broken beyond repair.  They are not as sturdy as we think, hearts are.  But rest assured, I do care for you very strongly, as my friend and companion.~
@627  = ~Well, let me see.  I do, for instance, have some ready hot chocolate.  Although a paladin should not carry contraband, these were imported for the Order by our friends from Matzica, and I took a small package with me to the shores of Lac Dinneshere.~
@628  = ~Would you care for a cup?  Note, I would have never offered if I did not like you.~
@629  = ~Indeed.  You got me there.~
@630  = ~Hot chocolate?  For me?  You REALLY like me.~
@631  = ~Maybe not tonight, but thank you.  It proves your devotion, I agree.~
@632  = ~Here you go, then.  I hope it invigorates you - this place looks bleak.  We all need some extra strength.~
@633  = ~I do have a strong admiration for you.  <CHARNAME>... your name, your grace, your leadership - the Order would be happy to have one such as you in our ranks.  Perhaps one day?~
@634  = ~I am not sure I am, you know, lawful enough.  Or good enough.  Or Order-ly enough.  But thanks.~
@635  = ~It would be fun!  Imagine what pranks we could pull!  We'll teach young paladins new tricks, steal the Prelate's tiara and make mayhem in general!~
@636  = ~I'd love that.  To keep travelling by your side, to have meaning in my life - the Church of Tyr or the Order of the Knights of Holy Judgement suits me very well.~
@637  = ~I think I would like to be an honorary member - if, of course, I'd still be free to travel and adventure on my own.~
@638  = ~It is my pleasure, <CHARNAME>.  Always.~
@639  = ~Ah... perhaps I have been too hasty in my judgment.~
@640  = ~Then we would be delighted to call you a sister in arms.~
@641  = ~If only we could stand and talk a little longer... but I fear that our time is up.  Take my hand, <CHARNAME>, if you will: the ground here is slippery.~
@642  = ~I do, from time to time.  As I find a particularly interesting library, or when I see children playing in the streets.  But if I want the books to be read, if I wish these children to be safe - I must fight for them.  We both know this.~
@643  = ~So, no peace for you?~
@644  = ~It is a pity.  But what if you die young, and no one remembers you?~
@645  = ~So if a beautiful young woman asks you to be her husband and protector...?~
@646  = ~None.  But there will be peace for someone else.~
@647  = ~I do not need to be remembered, <CHARNAME>.  We all make this world a little better - that's all that is needed.~
@648  = ~I would be honored, but who would have a paladin for a husband?  I may have little experience in such things, but I am led to believe that waiting at home for a man that never comes is an unfortunate experience.  And children born in such unions never truly know their father.~
@649  = ~Perhaps I am wrong, and a peaceful life would suit me much better.  But my heart tells me to be strong, to keep going.  I put my faith in Tyr: it is all I can do.~
@650  = ~I understand.~
@651  = ~It is a bleak perspective, though.~
@652  = ~But if a woman truly loved you, she would sacrifice the world for you.~
@653  = ~You know what divine grace is, <CHARNAME>.  Many good and strong people endure hardships and loneliness to make the world better.  Are they wrong?  Are we, here and now?~
@654  = ~No, I do not believe so.~
@655  = ~And I truly loved her, I would not let her.~
@656  = ~And we will, if you wish to.  One day, when Kuldahar is safe, we'll step outside at night, hand in hand, and count the falling stars.~
@657  = ~Promise?~
@658  = ~Will you make a wish, then?~
@659  = ~I know what I'll wish for when I see a falling star...~
@660  = ~They say your most important wish comes true if you are quick enough to make it while a star falls.~
@661  = ~I never thought about it much - perhaps because I had little to wish for.  But now... now I am not sure whether to make my wish or will myself not to wish it.~
@662  = ~There is something you want, but you are not sure whether to want it?~
@663  = ~You are talking in riddles, Holvir.~
@664  = ~Am I your wish?  Your feelings to me?~
@665  = ~You know the answer well enough.~
@666  = ~Romantic love is not a feeling that I have allowed myself to indulge in.  My path is hard; I would not wish it on anyone who is not fully sure of the commitment she might make.~
@667  = ~Let us not talk of it now.  <CHARNAME>, will you allow me something?~
@668  = ~Yes, what?~
@669  = ~Depending on what you're asking for.~
@670  = ~Hmm.  Now I'm suspicious.  What is it?~
@671  = ~My "no" shouldn't stop you, Holvir!  Be bolder.~
@672  = ~Still, in this case I'd much rather hear a "yes" - or a honest refusal.~
@673  = ~Here, take my hand and close your eyes.  Think of the starry sky above, of the ground below, of the moon and the wind upon your face - and make a wish.~
@674  = ~It will come true.~
@675  = ~Terribly, if you go.  I do not think anyone can forget you this easily, <CHARNAME>.~
@676  = ~But why ask?  Are you planning for us to part when our task is over?~
@677  = ~I do not know yet.~
@678  = ~Anything can happen.  Some of us can die, for instance.~
@679  = ~It may well come to be.~
@680  = ~Not for all the world.~
@681  = ~I am well aware.  A huge responsibility lies on your shoulders.  I would help you shoulder it, but the leader always bears the worst weight alone.~
@682  = ~It would be a very sad day indeed.~
@683  = ~I do not want to part with you.  You know this full well by now.  But our close friendship, our feelings, even our future matters very little if we differ in something fundamental.~
@684  = ~If, for one, you desire to settle down, or build a life of a powerful leader and ruler, and I stay on the road, we will see each other only rarely - and in a few years, perhaps, not at all, as you marry and start a family of your own.  And if it is your desire, it should be so.~
@685  = ~I do not want another family, or a life of a ruler.  I want to be on the road with you.~
@686  = ~Who knows what will happen?  But I want to stay near you for as long as I can.~
@687  = ~I know.  I will have to think on this.~
@688  = ~Does it mean that you want to stay with me forever?  Together?  Always?  Yay!~
@689  = ~Your road is yours.  But know this: I shall always keep the time we spent near the Spine of the World close to my heart, and it has been my privilege and my honor to be your friend.~
@690  = ~(Holvir leans very close and kisses your cheek.)~
@691  = ~Always.~
@692  = ~<CHARNAME>... sometimes I wish they taught your sense of humor in the Order.  I might have forgotten half of our road's hardships by now.~
@693  = ~You would be correct, yes.  But a long journey hardly differs from a short trip - except that you get used to the journey and are reluctant to leave your boat or your carriage in the end.~
@694  = ~I even think about it with some nostalgia:  I spent my time on the deck, reading books and listening to the tales of Luskan pirates from the more talkative members of the crew.  To think of it, more than one of them had probably been pirating in the past.~
@695  = ~But that's neither here nor there.  What about your own journey, lady <CHARNAME>?~
@696  = ~You know me: where I go, trouble follows.~
@697  = ~Uneventful, mostly.  I was a bit lonely, to tell you the truth.~
@698  = ~I was born in the Dale, so it was just a trip from one of the Ten Towns to another.~
@699  = ~Just a set of roads from point A to point B.  I do not remember much of it.~
@700  = ~Don't you get seasick, Holvir?~
@701  = ~Me?  No, not at all.  We are trained against seasickness in the Order - I could show you a few breathing exercises later, if you like.~
@702  = ~I doubt you were the cause of the trouble, my lady.  But, true, the Dale can be a perilous place.~
@703  = ~I am glad we finally stand together.  I grew used to the sense of belonging in the Order - I missed it on the road, but now, as I stand next to you, it is back, stronger than ever.~
@704  = ~But it is true that I rarely left Waterdeep before.  Not since I'd been knighted, in fact.  Would you like to hear the story of me acquiring knighthood, <CHARNAME>?  I would not like to test your patience.~
@705  = ~Holvir, am I right that you're alternating between "<CHARNAME>" and "lady <CHARNAME>" and can't rightly choose?~
@706  = ~You are not testing my patience at all.  Please, continue.~
@707  = ~I would like to hear it.~
@708  = ~Perhaps not. We have a task to do, after all.~
@709  = ~You are smiling, but it is perfectly true.  I am sorry... <CHARNAME>.  You are a true lady, but you are also my travelling companion, and there's little use for formalities in battle.~
@710  = ~I will try to be more consistent from now on.  Although it pleases me to say it: lady <CHARNAME>.~
@711  = ~As you say, then.  Lead on.~
@712  = ~It is customary for a squire to complete a task of valor before he is accepted to the ranks of the Order.  I could not wait for mine.  Yet, the mission never came.~
@713  = ~So, I set about my tasks, which were simple at the time: helping the city watch apprehend criminals, guard the streets at night and solve minor disputes.~
@714  = ~Yet very soon I noticed that the streets were plagued by strange mist just before sunrise.  Many locals also complained of an odd sickness that befell them in the morn.  So I set out to investigate.~
@715  = ~I spent my days searching for clues, kept my eyes open at night, and finally found a lead: a home of a fallen elven priestess of Ilmater, who now worshipped Shar.  A broken heart was her reason, I believe... and I felt sorry for her, despite everything.~
@716  = ~Mad with grief and revenge, the woman opened a portal which temporarily summoned a great and powerful demon, Belhifet.  I do not know what he promised her, but as a result, he impregnated her with his spawn and disappeared.~
@717  = ~As I found her, she lay dying, having given birth to a dead, disfigured child - the evil mist was her last desperate attempt to summon her demonic "lover" to her side again.  Needless to say, it failed.  I attempted to heal her, but she lost too much blood... and died within an hour.~
@718  = ~Why would you try to save her?  She nearly killed innocent people!~
@719  = ~So, in truth, you did nothing, because she died anyway?~
@720  = ~A dramatic story.  I am sorry you had to witness such things, Holvir.~
@721  = ~What happened then?~
@722  = ~Yet she deserved pity, and mercy, as do we all.  Otherwise what would be the point?  I'd be an executioner, not a vessel of Tyr's will.~
@723  = ~True... if harshly said.  But it is not all.~
@724  = ~The priestess had an accomplice - a scrawny sorcerer who had been packing his things as I entered his room.  He never even tried to help his "mistress".~
@725  = ~His magics were powerful enough, however... powerful enough to nearly leave me blind.  Fortunately, Tyr was with me, and I persevered.  In the morning I brought him to a magistrate.  The rest was out of my hands, but within a few days, my knighthood ceremony's date was set... and I became a full knight.~
@726  = ~You deserved it, too.~
@727  = ~What happened to the demon, Belhifet?~
@728  = ~Thank you for the story, Holvir.  I am honored by your trust.~
@729  = ~Do you think so?  I felt I was too slow, too distracted, I wish I could have done something sooner...  But there was no other way to solve it, was there?~
@730  = ~I do not know.  Although a part of me says we'll hear his name again, one way or another.~
@731  = ~As I am honored by your patience and attention.  Talking to you is a rare pleasure.~
@732  = ~But we have talked long.  I apologize for distracting you, <CHARNAME>: let us go.~
@733  = ~I would never do such a thing on purpose.  But if I need to protect my companions, protect you - should I not?  An injury is worth much less than a friend's life.~
@734  = ~Still, you're taking grave risks in battle.~
@735  = ~More than once, you saved my life, but were nearly cut in half.  I would never want that.~
@736  = ~What if I do not want you to pay such a price?~
@737  = ~I suppose I would do the same in your place.~
@738  = ~Tyr took grave risks to protect innocents.  I do not see why any of His faithful should do otherwise.~
@739  = ~But I know how hard it is to lose friends.  Being a squire, I lost a few on the battlefield myself.~
@740  = ~(Holvir suddenly smiles.) <CHARNAME>, I promise - I will do everything I can to remain hale until the end of the day.  After all, who will heal your wounds if I am not around?~
@741  = ~And you have a very soft and pleasant healing touch, by the way.~
@742  = ~You are not the only healer in our group, Holvir.~
@743  = ~Did I ever tell you that when you lay your hands on me, I go all trembling and weak in the knees?~
@744  = ~Thank you.  That's what I wanted to hear.~
@745  = ~I know.  Still, I feel that your health is my responsibility.~
@746  = ~(Holvir blinks.)~
@747  = ~Oh.  I... thank you?  That's not what I usually hear from my patients.~
@748  = ~I will be careful, <CHARNAME>.  Although in this, like in certain other matters, I shall naturally follow your lead.  So the question is, my dear friend: will you be careful, as well?~
@749  = ~You would likely laugh, <CHARNAME>, but this is a work of... fiction.  A fantasy novel.~
@750  = ~No, I won't laugh.  What is it about?~
@751  = ~Interesting.~
@752  = ~Is it a love story?~
@753  = ~It... has a love story in it, yes, although it is not the novel's primary purpose.~
@754  = ~The focus of the story is a young woman, a witch, who spends her days riding from one village to another, helping the simple folk in need - fighting monsters, defeating evil warlocks and even undead.  She's got a quick tongue and a sarcastic streak, but a good heart.~
@755  = ~Somehow, despite the differences, she reminds me of you.~
@756  = ~Does she?  Why?~
@757  = ~And her lover?  Is he a young and devoted paladin?~
@758  = ~An interesting book.  I'd like to read it.~
@759  = ~I reminded you of your first love, too.  I sense a pattern here.~
@760  = ~(Holvir colors slightly.)~
@761  = ~Indeed...  But it is more easily explained than you think.~
@762  = ~You both know what you want - a quality I am a little envious of.  You are headstrong, good-hearted - you did join Hrothgar's expedition, much as she became a witch to help people.  You're both willing to join a risky venture or to help a friend - and you are enchanting to look at.  Except...~
@763  = ~Ah... the heroine is not very fond of paladins, I'm afraid to say.  And, really, the ones depicted in the book are rather... single-minded.  One even wanted to burn her.~
@764  = ~Truly, I'd have thought we paladins deserved a little recognition... but I was mistaken, I see.  Or was I?~
@765  = ~Many paladins *are* single-minded, Holvir.~
@766  = ~Some of you do see the world in black and white.~
@767  = ~I don't know about the heroine, but I appreciate your help a great deal.~
@768  = ~Now you're simply asking for a compliment.  Of course you are needed, Holvir.  Paladins are valued guardians... and devoted friends.~
@769  = ~It was written in the lands of Rashemen, I believe: the land of Baba Yaga and other such myths. I do not think Volha's adventures will take her to the Sword Coast or the Icewind Dale... but I like the tale, nevertheless.  Except...~
@770  = ~Thank you.  You are a dear friend, <CHARNAME>.~
@771  = ~Indeed... but even they, too, serve a greater purpose.  Many of them save innocent lives, even though they receive nothing but scorn and sarcasm.~
@772  = ~I can be too vocal when I speak of my brethren, I know.  Which is understandable - but I would much rather not take up any more of your time with this.~
@773  = ~The book is in my backpack.  Please, feel free to borrow it, if you want some light reading for the night, yourself.~
@774  = ~<CHARNAME>!  Paladins of the Radiant Heart are punished by beheading if they violate their vows, and are hunted if they try to flee, you know.  I do not belong to that esteemed order, but you should be more careful with your desires.~
@775  = ~Oh, I know my desires.  The question is, do you know yours?~
@776  = ~But do *you* want me to be more careful?~
@777  = ~Aww.  No corrupting you, then?~
@778  = ~Holvir, do you really want to spend your entire life being so... uptight?~
@779  = ~Lady <CHARNAME>... I must ask.  Are you corrupting me - or flirting with me?~
@780  = ~Guess.~
@781  = ~A little bit of both?~
@782  = ~Corrupting you, of course!  You and I, we are going to rule the world!~
@783  = ~Don't you love my coquetry?~
@784  = ~I would lie if I said I did not enjoy the attention, but...  It is a little new to me.  The young ladies of Waterdeep were not so...~
@785  = ~Bold?~
@786  = ~Beautiful?~
@787  = ~Madly in love with you?~
@788  = ~(Holvir chokes.)  <CHARNAME>, sometimes your jokes can be...~
@789  = ~Let's change the topic.~
@790  = ~Indeed they weren't...~
@791  = ~In any case, I will do anything in my power to keep *you* on the side of light.  Very firmly so.~
@792  = ~How firmly?  Will you pin me down under you?  Hold my arms so I can't escape?~
@793  = ~Sounds intriguing.~
@794  = ~I appreciate the effort, but I am a big girl, Holvir.~
@795  = ~You can try, of course...~
@796  = ~I... have a sudden and immediate desire to escape this conversation.  Right now.~
@797  = ~(sigh) Something tells me that your thoughts at the moment aren't exactly good and righteous, are they?~
@798  = ~And your mind is your own.  I know.  But if you need a friend - I stand next to you.~
@799  = ~I... am sure I know nothing whatsoever about this incident.  Although, if asked, I might say that...~
@800  = ~Yes?~
@801  = ~That you like me?~
@802  = ~That you were the one who placed them?~
@803  = ~These were very beautiful flowers, by the way.~
@804  = ~That the lady in question deserves much more.  That a poor knight once saw her hair blazing in the sunset and thought he might be falling in love.  And... although he might have no right to say that, the knight is still falling... and has no idea where he might end up.~
@805  = ~In my lap, I hope?  I'll keep him warm after such a long fall.~
@806  = ~So, the flowers *were* from you!  I knew it!~
@807  = ~We'll find out together, won't we?~
@808  = ~Was that a confession?~
@809  = ~(Holvir shakes his head.)~
@810  = ~I never mentioned any names, <CHARNAME>.  Let the giver of the bouquet remain a mystery, for now.~
@811  = ~For now.  But one day...~
@812  = ~All right.~
@813  = ~But why?  Will we disrupt the party if you openly give me a rose and acknowledge your feelings?~
@814  = ~One day.~
@815  = ~Some things are worth waiting for, aren't they?  Besides... sometimes too much happiness makes one careless.  When your head spins, it is too easy to miss the enemy's swing.~
@816  = ~A friend of mine, a fellow squire from Daggerford, died not two days after his engagement was announced.  We were searching for a bandit camp; he went scouting and missed an enemy archer in the trees.~
@817  = ~I keep telling myself it was a black set of circumstances.  But I remember his shining face, his wide smile, an absent-minded aura around him, and I ask myself: what if he waited?~
@818  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>.  I shouldn't have told you this.~
@819  = ~No, I understand.~
@820  = ~I still think waiting is wrong.~
@821  = ~I would much rather risk it and spend these days in your arms.~
@822  = ~I think I know what you mean.  And thank you for the flowers.~
@823  = ~You are my anchor these days.  My touchstone.~
@824  = ~You don't know how I long to say the same.  But we walk under a great shadow.  I cannot take a step towards you until we chase it away.~
@825  = ~As you are mine.  Perhaps... yes, this is the right time, after all.  <CHARNAME>, may I show you something?~
@826  = ~Of course.  Let's come aside.~
@827  = ~I hope it comes in a small velvet box.~
@828  = ~What is it, Holvir?~
@829  = ~You're not calling me "lady <CHARNAME>" these days.  I am disappointed.~
@830  = ~My lady <CHARNAME>... I would call you my fair lady endlessly, if I could.  But in the battle?  Amidst our friends and companions, who would have no formalities?  It would sound odd, wouldn't it?~
@831  = ~But I will say it again one more time.  Lady <CHARNAME>...~
@832  = ~It does not, but simply because I had no time to acquire one.~
@833  = ~We are alone now.  Good.  Here, take a look at this brooch.  It is a silver nightingale - a bird many bards consider a beautiful nightsinger and a muse.~
@834  = ~You are a dear friend to me, and perhaps... as we both know... more than that.  Will you accept this small token from me?  Miles and days may separate us, but I would like you to have something to remember me by.~
@835  = ~Thank you.  It is a lovely gift.~
@836  = ~I do not need anything special to remember you, Holvir.  But I accept the gift gladly.~
@837  = ~I want to remain by your side.  I do not want anything to separate us.~
@838  = ~I cannot accept this, Holvir.  I am sorry.~
@839  = ~I... find it hard to talk.  Something presses at my throat, it constricts, and I cannot speak.  But...~
@840  = ~When our enemy lies dead, we will exchange words again, I promise.  I swear.~
@841  = ~Who knows what the future will bring?  But if you haven't known that my desire matches yours, know now: I do not want to part with you, either, whatever comes.~
@842  = ~Then... simply accept my friendship.  And know that I will do anything for you, if the need comes.~
@843  = ~I wish it were so.  A tragic love story is something one can survive.  But a loss of a limb, of an eye, or of magic, the most important part of my soul?  That's much harder.~
@844  = ~Although... When I came to Easthaven, I was empty, and for months, I felt like my deity, Hanali, abandoned me.  But I doubt it can pass for a love story.~
@845  = ~So, no, <CHARNAME>.  I lost my magic, my dignity, my wealth and any connection to my family, but there is nothing romantic whatsoever in that.~
@846  = ~I beg to differ.  A mysterious elven ranger who mysteriously lost his magical powers, mysteriously lived in the forest and finally joined a mysterious expedition for his own mysterious reasons?  Incredibly romantic.~
@847  = ~Good!  I am relieved.  I thought I'd have to compete with some unknown Everaskian beauty, and I really didn't want that.~
@848  = ~I see.  Well, thank you for indulging my interest.~
@849  = ~Of course.  As our leader, you need to know these things, after all.  Our lives and deaths are yours, for the moment.  Although...~
@850  = ~(Korin looks as if he wants both to laugh and to roll his eyes, then suddenly blinks.)~
@851  = ~Well, if there indeed has been an Evereskian beauty in my life, you are better informed than I.  But...~
@852  = ~I... did I hear correctly?  I wouldn't want to presume anything, but are you... how shall I put it... interested in me?~
@853  = ~What if I am?  You'll have to live with that, my dear elf.~
@854  = ~I never said that.~
@855  = ~Me?  Oh, no.  Idle curiosity, that's all it was.~
@856  = ~I see.  Well, I can only add that I am flattered by your... curiosity?~
@857  = ~But I am a bad candidate for anything of the sort, <CHARNAME>.  For one, I am out of practice - years away from any sort of society can do it to a man.~
@858  = ~Besides, without my magic, I am hardly more than a cripple.  And should my gift suddenly return, I'll start treating you - and our companions - with little more than contempt and cruel sarcasm.~
@859  = ~So, which one are you?  A cripple or an arrogant wizard who'd squash me like a bug?~
@860  = ~I like cruel sarcasm!  It's very arousing, isn't it?  A clever man who knows what he wants?~
@861  = ~I'd never believe that.  You are a good man, Korin.  This is why I like you.~
@862  = ~I'd never do anything of the sort, you know this.  Well, not without my magic, anyway.  I...~
@863  = ~(sigh) And you've trapped me within my own web of words completely, I see.~
@864  = ~And abandons the girl as soon as he gets one thing - or, rather, one night - he needs from her?  I doubt you'd find that arousing or pleasing, <CHARNAME>.~
@865  = ~You flatter me.  Shamelessly, I might add.  But I...~
@866  = ~Let us continue this another time.  We barely know each other, after all.~
@867  = ~After you, <CHARNAME>.~
@868  = ~Clearly, since I'm walking here next to you wielding a bow, not standing on a dais in my robes summoning a horde of Baatezu.  Or naked succubi, if that is your thing.  Although demon summoning has never been my area of expertise.~
@869  = ~Seriously, though, I doubt Hanali was pleased with my nature.  But romantic love can take many forms - perhaps she hoped to find one for me?  Or I hoped to find someone... subconsciously, perhaps?  I do not know.  I may never know now.~
@870  = ~What if the lady in question is walking next to you?~
@871  = ~Hanali knew you weren't hopeless, Korin.  Just as I do.~
@872  = ~A pity.  I wish gods announced their desires clearly.  Like: "Hey, Korin, you're an arrogant bastard and I'm going to strip all your magic from you, and THEN you'll fall in love!"  Or something like that.~
@873  = ~And the lady knows my own mind better than I do?  (But Korin smiles, and you see he appreciates your words.)~
@874  = ~A... novel thought.  I suppose we have to be thankful that you've yet to join the pantheon of gods.  Things would be very much in uproar when you do.~
@875  = ~The thought is appreciated, but I hardly think it's true.  Rather, you're saying what I think I want to hear, am I correct?~
@876  = ~Tell me something, <CHARNAME>.  Why do you keep asking me these questions?  Not that I mind - Seldarine sees, our journey is exhausting enough, and talking to you certainly helps.  But why me in particular?~
@877  = ~You spent years away from female company.  I'm trying to get you into shape again.~
@878  = ~Whetting your appetite?~
@879  = ~What do you think?~
@880  = ~Because I like you, and it is as simple as that?~
@881  = ~I appreciate the effort.  It might be fruitless, however: your company may spoil me completely, and afterwards I'll find other women lacking.~
@882  = ~(sigh) "A shameless flirt" doesn't cover a half of it, I see.  Aren't young ladies discouraged from saying such things until, oh, I do not know, a much later stage in courtship?  Assuming we have one, of course.~
@883  = ~I think I am rather lucky, but I'm still puzzled as to the source of my sudden luck.~
@884  = ~Returning to your original question, perhaps I was wrong to pay so much attention to my studies and spells, and so little - to simple things, like nature, sunsets, beautiful faces, dance and laughter?  I do not know.~
@885  = ~Perhaps now is my chance?~
@886  = ~(Korin's fingers find yours for a moment. His face, however, remains tight.)~
@887  = ~The People... Elves walked here, so many years ago... And now...~
@888  = ~<CHARNAME>, do me a favor.  A big, huge, enormous favor, perhaps the one I've no right to ask.~
@889  = ~What is it, Korin?~
@890  = ~Anything for you.~
@891  = ~Depending on what the favor is.~
@892  = ~Come here.  Stand next to me, with your shoulder close to mine.~
@893  = ~Pretend that we are not where we are.  For one minute, dream with me.  Dream of the green grasses of Kuldahar and of the evergreen whispers in the leaves.  Of snow quietly falling over Lac Dinnershere and of a single light in the tavern's window.  Of music and laughter beyond the wooden walls.  Of coming home.~
@894  = ~I need to remember that everything's not hopeless.~
@895  = ~(Kiss his cheek)  Everything's not hopeless, Korin.  I am with you.~
@896  = ~Actually, it is.  And we're all going to die.  Except not!~
@897  = ~(inhale)  You know, I like your smell.  And your shoulder is warm.  Can I stand here with you for a little while?~
@898  = ~I know.  And I remember now.~
@899  = ~(Korin touches his cheek.)~
@900  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@901  = ~Well, if you have more than enough vigor in you to make jokes, then definitely we are not.~
@902  = ~I am glad you are here.~
@903  = ~(He silently puts an arm around your shoulders, and you stand for a while in comfortable silence. Finally, Korin speaks.)~
@904  = ~There's this old joke I heard in Evereska.  Several boys roll in the snow, laughing.  Then a stern-looking grandmother calls one of them home.  The boy asks: "Granny, am I cold?" - "No, dear, you're hungry."~
@905  = ~I didn't want to be that little boy when I was his age.  But now I wish that every and each fallen man, woman and child from the Hand of the Seldarine could fly back to their ancestral homes and be sheltered and safe with their families, like that boy.  To a welcoming fire, arms of a friend... something beyond eternal cold and loneliness.~
@906  = ~Thank you for standing here with me: I feel better now.   Not for long, but even a stolen moment helps.~
@907  = ~Now come.  Let us do the best we can.~
@908  = ~Somehow, I doubt I would get an entirely full and honest answer, should I ask you about the same set of matters.~
@909  = ~Well, *I* haven't been practicing anchoritism for the last few years, thank you very much!~
@910  = ~Why, I'd provide you with a full answer.  Ask.~
@911  = ~No-no-no-no-no!  You won't be able to change the subject.  I was asking about yourself.~
@912  = ~Oh, I do not doubt that.  Something tells me that you wouldn't be able to: young men, impressed by your charms, would turn any lonely hut or cabin of yours into a place of pilgrimage.~
@913  = ~Not that I'm the one to throw stones at them, of course.~
@914  = ~About your romantic past?  I rather wouldn't.  Here's the problem with questions like yours: you can always get an honest answer.  And I sometimes hate these.~
@915  = ~I haven't been with anyone since I left Evereska.  And, no, I took no vows.  Is this what you wished to know?~
@916  = ~Ah.  Oh.  Excuse me while I'll go and blush somewhere in the corner.~
@917  = ~... Very honest.~
@918  = ~Yes, absolutely.  Thank you, Korin.~
@919  = ~Oh, I do have other questions, you know.  I just wonder when you are going to break and tell me to mind my own business.~
@920  = ~The strange thing is, I do not want to.  Why is that, I wonder?~
@921  = ~(Korin hesitantly places a hand on your shoulder.)~
@922  = ~<CHARNAME>... I did not wish to embarrass you by a straight answer.  I am sorry if I did.~
@923  = ~You did, a little.  But it was completely my own fault, so it's all right.~
@924  = ~Apology accepted.~
@925  = ~No, everything's completely fine.~
@926  = ~Um... er... let's just finish this conversation.~
@927  = ~(He nods silently and leaves you be.)~
@928  = ~I know you a little by now, and I would venture to say that you and I are alike in one thing: we would never choose to be with someone just for the sake of not being alone.~
@929  = ~So, my forced celibacy in Easthaven is rather easily explained: while it would be amazing to wake up with a woman I love, who'd stretch next to me in the morning light, completely naked, I refuse to fall asleep with just anyone.  Would you behave differently?~
@930  = ~I suppose not.~
@931  = ~But you must have wants... dreams... desires...~
@932  = ~Hmm, given how your bedroll was next to mine last night, and you fell asleep rather quickly, what am I to think?~
@933  = ~Naked... Do you ever picture me naked, Korin?  I wonder.~
@934  = ~You do not want an honest answer to this one, believe me.  Especially right now.~
@935  = ~There is your answer.~
@936  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, if I told you of my desires *now*, you would not thank me.  My imagination can carry me away to strange places... or, rather, too closely for your liking.~
@937  = ~That you should be happy that elves, in general, do not snore?~
@938  = ~But perhaps we have had enough of this talk.  Cold as the Dale is, I'd rather... not risk continuing it.~
@939  = ~Why, I think it should remain a mystery.  It would be too boring if I answered your every question in full, wouldn't it?~
@940  = ~Korin!~
@941  = ~Hey, you possibly witnessed me bathing!  Naked!  Without as much as an undershirt on!  My honor demands... well, demands!~
@942  = ~Never mind.  I was just teasing you.  I'm grateful you let me bathe in peace.~
@943  = ~(Korin raises an eyebrow.)  You know, it's been years since someone called me by my name with such emotion.  I am positively enjoying it.~
@944  = ~Curiously, it was exactly what I was thinking of as I stood my guard.  That if anyone disturbed your peace - be it a drow assassin, Elminster in disguise, a wealthy quest-giver, a stray goblin or a lost beholder - he'd get an arrow in the eye. Whether you were disrobed or not.~
@945  = ~Oh, Korin, I had no idea you were so... dedicated.  Thank you.~
@946  = ~And I appreciate it a great deal.~
@947  = ~I was disrobed, in case you were curious.~
@948  = ~So... did you take a peek at my gorgeous forms or not?~
@949  = ~(Korin simply smiles.)~
@950  = ~I kept my back to you all the time, if you're still wondering.  Trust of a friend is too important to risk it.  Especially if this friend is you.~
@951  = ~Do you trust me?~
@952  = ~I am touched.~
@953  = ~Just a friend?~
@954  = ~Implicitly.  With my life, certainly.  But that much is obvious: we all trust you with our lives, after all.~
@955  = ~I'd like to quip and say that I'd think twice before trusting you with my heart - but something tells me that the choice has already been made for me.~
@956  = ~How long ago, I wonder?~
@957  = ~If there is anything at all I can do for you, I will.  It is as simple as that.~
@958  = ~You will never fall, <CHARNAME> - but if you ever do, I'll catch you.~
@959  = ~You should know better than to ask by now.  Who'd answer "yes" at this point, anyway?  A blind otyugh, maybe, but certainly not me.~
@960  = ~Indeed.  But the time for that will come soon enough, trust me.~
@961  = ~Will you just sit with me for a while, instead?  Here, on this ledge, while we're alone.~
@962  = ~Will you kiss me?  I really hope you'll kiss me.~
@963  = ~Alone... and willing to do something improper, I hope?~
@964  = ~(Korin raises an eyebrow, but very tenderly kisses the corner of your cheek.)~
@965  = ~Here.  I did tell you I was out of practice, did I?~
@966  = ~Ah... not this time, although I am sorely tempted.  More sorely than you know, possibly.~
@967  = ~I've been dreaming a little about everyday things we might do after our task is done.  And I had a rather bizarre idea that somehow still feels right.~
@968  = ~Do you remember how we walked in knee-deep snow from Easthaven to Kuldahar?  Well... what about a ski trip, instead?  No high-risk skiing in the mountains - but you and I, sliding easily in the snow, twice as fast and thrice as easy.  Wouldn't it be a sight to watch?~
@969  = ~Me, stumbling and falling over my ass every several steps?  A grand sight indeed.~
@970  = ~Why not?  It could be fun.~
@971  = ~I'm willing to give it a try.  But when the snow giants come,  you'd better be good with that bow.~
@972  = ~I'm fine with mountain skiing, too.  Wind in my face, speed and the sun - it feels great.  After all, this is the Icewind Dale!~
@973  = ~Wait.  You called me aside, I am alone with you - and we're discussing skiing?  Someone here is a little crazy.~
@974  = ~You're giving yourself too little credit.  You're graceful enough to kick a yeti in the, ahem, knees - why not walk a mile wearing a well-oiled pair of skis while the snow carries you by itself?~
@975  = ~Absolutely.  With tea and hot pies waiting for us near a lit fire when we come back to civilization.~
@976  = ~Was there ever any doubt?~
@977  = ~It is indeed!  And by Hanali, I'll join you in a heartbeat.~
@978  = ~I know.  But if we ever do what you're so gracefully hinting at, I would prefer it to be in a proper room with a freshly made bed, and no enemies breathing down our necks.~
@979  = ~I am just... sometimes I want you all to myself.  And not just in the sense you've just thought of.  I want to spend time with you when this land is at peace, learn of your likes and dislikes outside of battle, become closer over a glass of wine, not standing back to back in a narrow crypt passage.~
@980  = ~I sometimes hope it is your wish, as well.~
@981  = ~The proverbial yeti in the room.  We really must talk about this, Korin.~
@982  = ~It is.  Skiing with you in the Dale - or just walking around Kuldahar.~
@983  = ~We'll have to win, first, remember.  It might not be that easy.~
@984  = ~Oh, come on!  Do away with your false modesty, Korin.  You perfectly well know that it is.~
@985  = ~But what about the element of mystery?  I'll become as boring as your wife.~
@986  = ~We will.  Soon.  But there is joy in anticipation, isn't there?~
@987  = ~I am looking forward to it.  You'll find me quite pliant to your will: as long as your hand is near mine, I'd agree to anything, I fear.~
@988  = ~<CHARNAME>... (sigh) Had there been one minute, one hour, one second, during which you honestly, truthfully thought that our enemy would win?~
@989  = ~I do not have a wife, <CHARNAME>.  Although now that you've mentioned it...~
@990  = ~I do not feel I know the depth of your heart - yet.  But here's one more thing I want you to know.~
@991  = ~You'll always be able to rely on me.  No matter what comes, I am your friend.  Everything else... we'll figure it out as we go.~
@992  = ~I do, as I've told you before.  But I am glad for the company.  What about you, <CHARNAME>?~
@993  = ~I like your company.  But I wouldn't want to be in the center of attention.~
@994  = ~I prefer to be surrounded by people.  Solitude is not for me.~
@995  = ~A few friends and loved ones are enough for me.~
@996  = ~I would be very lonely if I had to live on my own.~
@997  = ~I prefer being alone.~
@998  = ~It's a curious thing, isn't it?  So many cultures equate being alone with punishment.  Yet solitude has two incredible advantages.  The first one that comes to my head is coming to terms with oneself.~
@999  = ~And the second one?~
@1000 = ~Not everyone is capable of it.~
@1001 = ~True enough.  Still, years in solitude?  Rather extreme.~
@1002 = ~I agree.  But sometimes it is either that, or years of regrets and humiliation.  And I know which I would choose.~
@1003 = ~(Korin looks at you and suddenly smiles.)~
@1004 = ~The second advantage would be appreciating new company with new vigor.  And new hope, perhaps?~
@1005 = ~Come, we can speak more of it as we walk.~
@1006 = ~Hmm?  Oh, no idea whatsoever.  I wasn't even aware...  Did it bother you?~
@1007 = ~No, I found that rather sweet.~
@1008 = ~A little.~
@1009 = ~Did you want to tell me something?~
@1010 = ~So... do you find me beautiful?~
@1011 = ~Still, I shouldn't have.~
@1012 = ~My apologies.  I was deep in my thoughts, and I wasn't watching where I was looking... so to speak.~
@1013 = ~What were you thinking about?~
@1014 = ~It's all right.  No harm done.~
@1015 = ~No, not particularly.  I was just thinking... and apparently forgot my manners.  My apologies.~
@1016 = ~(Korin blinks.)  What?  Oh...  <CHARNAME>, you know full well that you are.~
@1017 = ~I was thinking of my years in the Evereskan Academy of Magic.  Of struggling apprentices and wise mentors, proud beauties and my fierce competitors.~
@1018 = ~All of them would shun me, turn away from me, look at me with contempt and whisper behind my back, if they ever learnt of my predicament.  Yet you did not.  When I confessed my loss of magic, I saw only kindness and compassion from you.  Why is that, <CHARNAME>?~
@1019 = ~You're judging your colleagues too harshly.  Didn't you have friends there?~
@1020 = ~Because it's the most natural reaction.  What happened to you was horrible.~
@1021 = ~You're my friend.  What should I do, mock you instead?~
@1022 = ~I don't know, Korin.~
@1023 = ~Oh, no.  No.  Korin of Evereska was above such mundane values, I'm afraid to say.~
@1024 = ~And well-deserved, some would say.  Yet not you.~
@1025 = ~No.  No, you would indeed never do that to me... would you?~
@1026 = ~Perhaps it wasn't my place to ask.  Regardless, thank you.  It feels like I'm standing on solid ground again.~
@1027 = ~If there is something I can do for you in return, tell me.  I would like to be helpful.~
@1028 = ~If I need something, sure.~
@1029 = ~You don't owe me anything, Korin.~
@1030 = ~A huge bag of gold?  Well, you never know who may possess it.~
@1031 = ~Oooh, so many things!  Flowers, chocolate, an extra pair of fur mittens and...~
@1032 = ~Thank you again.  And I will try to keep my eyes to myself from now on.  Not such as an easy task as I'd have hoped...~
@1033 = ~Don't I?  Well, you have my friendship, at the very least.~
@1034 = ~And you never know who it might be stolen from, and where the former owner is, so I wouldn't risk it.~
@1035 = ~A Bag of Holding to carry the rest?  But I acquired a second pair of mittens in Easthaven, and my hands might be just small enough for you.  Here.~
@1036 = ~I would, although now is not really the time.  But perhaps it will distract me from my thoughts: today these are rather darker than I'm used to.  The Hand of the Seldarine... but enough.~
@1037 = ~Both my parents are mages.  Not "were", like me: from what I know, their gifts are alive and well.  My mother is a famous diplomat and a peacemaker: she travelled the Realms much in her youth.~
@1038 = ~Now she teaches in the Academy.  I would not call her beautiful, but she is very kind, tactful and unobtrusive.  Whenever I or any of my childhood friends needed help, she always was there.~
@1039 = ~What of your father?~
@1040 = ~Do your parents love each other?~
@1041 = ~You are lucky indeed.~
@1042 = ~I am.  I miss her, more than I admit even to myself.  But I could not... cannot... (sigh) Not now.~
@1043 = ~My father loved my mother from the very day he saw her, but years had passed before he said the words aloud.  He was a priest then - or, rather, merely an initiate, and served as her aide and healer as she travelled on her missions.~
@1044 = ~She helped him embrace his magical skill, and he saved her life a few times - although she saved his, as well, I'd wager.~
@1045 = ~For years, my father remained my mother's friend and confidant, but one adventure changed everything.  They were betrayed during a negotiation, and had to escape through the deep tunnels that were connected to the Underdark.  A drow patrol was pursuing them; the dead-end cave where they hid had collapsed.  They were nearly out of air, and rescue wasn't coming.~
@1046 = ~But they obviously survived... right?  After all, they had you.~
@1047 = ~What did they do?~
@1048 = ~And your father confessed?~
@1049 = ~Wouldn't you, in his place?~
@1050 = ~They did nothing, because they could do nothing - out of spells, exhausted, buried behind a layer of rock, they could only wait for the inevitable.~
@1051 = ~And then, as voices of the drow on the other side grew louder, my father simply said the words.  He loved her.~
@1052 = ~She did not have time to answer:  the next moment a portion of the wall disappeared, and no one else but the famous Jarlaxle, a mercenary and an opportunist from the drow city of Menzoberranzan appeared before them.~
@1053 = ~It turned out that an enemy of Jarlaxle's band was directly responsible for the betrayal, so Jarlaxle wanted my mother to foil his plans.  Which she had, years later.  But what are a few years for a drow?~
@1054 = ~What about your father's confession?  Did she return his love?~
@1055 = ~Amazing.  Jarlaxle himself saved them?~
@1056 = ~That's convenient.~
@1057 = ~(Korin smiles.)~
@1058 = ~Once safely back in Evereska, she simply took my father's arm and led him to Hanali's temple.  I believe it was the most sudden wedding of the year, and the most talked-about one.~
@1059 = ~I am happy they have each other.  Would that I one day could...~
@1060 = ~But it does not matter.  Let us go, <CHARNAME>.~
@1061 = ~Naturally.  But while frolicking amidst the flowers has its charm, doing it in a frozen valley or a dark cave is a trifle risky, don't you think?~
@1062 = ~What about laughing or telling jokes?  Too risky, too?~
@1063 = ~Frolicking in the woods... Would you want to frolic with me?~
@1064 = ~You bet.  Especially if several ice salamanders suddenly decide to join you.~
@1065 = ~(Korin's eyebrows disappear into his hairline.)  Was that a serious offer?  No, don't answer: I'm not sure I want to know.~
@1066 = ~I could do without that kind of company, true.  Your company, on the other hand...~
@1067 = ~But enough of this.~
@1068 = ~I'm not a soul of the company, <CHARNAME>.  Picturing me as one would only lead to disappointment for everyone involved, I'm afraid.~
@1069 = ~Although I wouldn't mind some lighthearted celebration once in a while.  Especially if you are present.~
@1070 = ~Count on it!  A drinking, joking, laughing Korin?  Won't miss it for the world.~
@1071 = ~And I am so going to get you drunk...~
@1072 = ~Aren't you afraid that you and I may do something improper in the heat of celebration?~
@1073 = ~I have a sudden suspicion that you placed rather a heavy accent on "drinking".  You aren't planning anything of the sort, are you?~
@1074 = ~<CHARNAME>, don't even think of it.  We are half-starved and tired, so even a single mug of ale would knock me off my feet.  I do not know about you, but I wouldn't want to find myself in a situation where I couldn't look into your eyes in the morning.~
@1075 = ~You aren't looking into my eyes as it is!  Mostly watching me out of the corner of your eye.~
@1076 = ~So, no laughing Korin, then?  Aww.~
@1077 = ~That would be bad, wouldn't it?~
@1078 = ~Sounds enticing, though.  Besides, I could just blindfold you.~
@1079 = ~Do I, really?  I've never noticed.~
@1080 = ~I've had precious little to smile about since my magic left me.  But I do keep smiling in your company, strangely enough.~
@1081 = ~Incredibly so.  Think of what our companions will say, for one.  Although when I look at a certain young lady and see a bright and dangerous expression in her eyes, I find myself not caring.~
@1082 = ~(Korin wordlessly covers his face with his palm and groans.)~
@1083 = ~In any case, let us go.  Otherwise the others *will* become interested in our heated discussion, and I wouldn't like that one bit.~
@1084 = ~He didn't.  His herbs and potions classes were a disaster, too, in case you are wondering.~
@1085 = ~No one ever cooks in Evereska, you know.  They say they do, but it's all half-cooked omelets and hastily conjured cheese and bits of fruit and whatever brand of elverquisst is available.~
@1086 = ~Students have little time for such things, and mages - even less.  My own mother never cooked, herself.  At the Academy, I just ate whatever was available.~
@1087 = ~But things obviously changed for you.~
@1088 = ~I wish I could see the way you were back then.~
@1089 = ~You must've been thin, acidic and angry.~
@1090 = ~Not that much, to be honest.  I've little enough preference for one type of food over another.  But as for my character... perhaps.~
@1091 = ~Very accurate.  Although I, of course, believed myself perfect, and woe befell those who thought differently.~
@1092 = ~I could show you the old me for a moment, if you wish.  You'll see that getting an edible dinner cooked by *that* man would be nothing short of a miracle, and surviving the experience - even less.~
@1093 = ~You must have been fun at romantic dinners.~
@1094 = ~Of course!  I'm all eyes and ears.~
@1095 = ~Will *I* survive the experience?~
@1096 = ~Couldn't you conjure imps or order golems to cook for you, like other mages?~
@1097 = ~Erm... I am not so sure...~
@1098 = ~Funnily enough, I do not remember many.~
@1099 = ~<CHARNAME>, I might have been an idiot back then, but I did have some taste in... company.  You are perfectly safe with any version of me.~
@1100 = ~Golems?  Cooking and handling dishes?  I'd like to see that... no, I wouldn't.  Too much broken glass.~
@1101 = ~And getting imps to cook for you usually results in smoke everywhere.  Especially if you, like any other first-year student, mix your vowels and conjure mephits and imps together.  A perfect Blood War miniature.~
@1102 = ~(Korin momentarily closes his eyes, and a shadow falls on his handsome face.  His chin jerks up, his upper lip curls in a sneer, and when his eyes open again and survey you coolly, you are indeed looking at a very different man.)~
@1103 = ~So, you are that barbarian girl my new self is traveling with.  Not a bad figure, although your hips could be smaller.  Ugh.  Do any of you lot ever brush your hair?  And what is this?  A bow or a discarded broom?~
@1104 = ~By Hanali, you look like a set of paupers, woman!  I suggest you never return this Korin to the civilized lands: I am sure my own dear mother could never stand the shame, not to mention the High Council.  I've little desire to endure your bodily odors any longer, myself.~
@1105 = ~(Korin shrugs, blinks, his face suddenly returning to normal, and the illusion disappears.)~
@1106 = ~Proves my point, I assume.  I... did not mean any of that, of course. You... were you insulted?~
@1107 = ~I am!  For your information, I do brush my hair!  Or at least did... before it got all tangled again.~
@1108 = ~Given how I'm taking the pains to bathe in *icy water*, that line about body odors certainly was an unnecessary one.~
@1109 = ~Smaller hips, hmm?~
@1110 = ~A set of paupers?  Us?  Our weapons alone cost a small fortune!~
@1111 = ~Do you really think your mother could never stand the shame?~
@1112 = ~He wasn't that bad.  Needed a little grooming, maybe.~
@1113 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am sorry.  I simply thought of a few insults that definitely weren't true, but it's all too easy to slip with such things.  Do forgive me, if you can.~
@1114 = ~No.  No, I don't.  I am... not ready to see her quite yet, however.~
@1115 = ~(sigh) Don't we all.~
@1116 = ~And... for the record, I do admire your hips a great deal.~
@1117 = ~But I still didn't answer your question - or, rather, an undeserved compliment - about my cooking skills.  The answer is very simple: I spent my entire days alone, with little to do when a snowstorm howled outside.~
@1118 = ~I hadn't even considered cooking for the first few months, but then Hrothgar invited me for dinner a few times, and I started appreciating the value of a home-cooked meal after a long, tiring day in the wilderness.~
@1119 = ~The rest of the townsfolk were surprisingly eager to give the newcomer a few tips and pointers, and soon enough, my cooking was pronounced passable by Grisella herself - you remember her in the tavern, don't you?~
@1120 = ~So... that's the entire story.  And should you visit my cabin, I promise to make you the best warming winter meal you've ever enjoyed in the Dale, be it twice-baked trout potatoes or an old-fashioned ukha.  There's no shortage of fish in the lake, after all.~
@1121 = ~Are you inviting me to dinner, Korin?~
@1122 = ~Fish might not be really my thing, but your cabin?  With you?  Count me in!~
@1123 = ~Absolutely!  I'm looking forward to it.~
@1124 = ~As long as the current you is the one preparing the meal.~
@1125 = ~We'll see.~
@1126 = ~Indeed I am, and with great pleasure, too.~
@1127 = ~Count on it.  I think... no, I am positive that the other Korin will definitely be unavailable.~
@1128 = ~Let's hope a snowstorm won't lock us inside.  Although, now that I'm imagining it...  it wouldn't be so bad, would it?~
@1129 = ~<CHARNAME>, dear one... I am not going anywhere.  Would I be as cruel as to abandon a friend just because we no longer share a common task?~
@1130 = ~And now that you've said you do not want me to leave, they'll have to pry me from your side with a white-hot crowbar.  And even then they'll fail miserably.~
@1131 = ~That's what I wanted to hear!~
@1132 = ~Good.  I do not want to lose you.~
@1133 = ~Hold me?  Please.~
@1134 = ~(He kisses you on the cheek and lets you go.)~
@1135 = ~All right.  But I am here, <CHARNAME>.  With you.  And not going anywhere.~
@1136 = ~(Korin slowly, reverently wraps his arms around you, his breath tickling your ear lightly.)~
@1137 = ~You know what?  We are going to dance.~
@1138 = ~Right here?  Right now?~
@1139 = ~What will the others think?~
@1140 = ~Oh.  Ah.  Wow?~
@1141 = ~But... I can't dance.~
@1142 = ~Korin, I appreciate the offer, but - no.  Just no.~
@1143 = ~Indeed.~
@1144 = ~Well, since they survived your giggling sessions with Teri, I'd say we have nothing to be afraid of.~
@1145 = ~Just let me lead.  Put an arm around my shoulders, take my hand, look into my eyes... and let go.~
@1146 = ~(Korin takes a deep breath without taking his gaze from you.  You don't hear music, but there is magic in the rhythm, in the movements of his graceful body, in looking into his eyes, in being held so close.)~
@1147 = ~If we were dancing in front of a mirror, you'd see yourself: elegant, captivating, graceful.  Do you feel it?  There is nothing between us but the dance.~
@1148 = ~(He kisses your hair, his own eyes half-closed, breathing in your scent.)~
@1149 = ~It is so strange.  Your every move is surrender, letting me hold you and look at you and move you.  And yet... you are winning.~
@1150 = ~Am I?~
@1151 = ~And my prize is...?~
@1152 = ~And enjoying it, too.~
@1153 = ~Thank you for the dance, Korin.~
@1154 = ~Without a doubt.~
@1155 = ~Ah.  That's the question, isn't it?~
@1156 = ~The pleasure is all mine, believe me.~
@1157 = ~Once all of this is over, I would like to hold you again.  Enveloped by music, lost in your eyes, dreaming... wanting... breathing in...  But I should let go of you before we are ambushed on the spot.~
@1158 = ~Come.  The end is in sight.~
@1159 = ~It was, often enough.  I had no one to watch me as I set camp in the wilderness.  But one learns to be a light sleeper quite soon.  And I... learnt to rely on myself.~
@1160 = ~With a quarterstaff and a quick fist, I doubt it not.  You've never been in danger?~
@1161 = ~Bandits must have seen you as an easy prey: a young woman, alone...~
@1162 = ~You hesitate.  Is there a story behind it?~
@1163 = ~It must have been tough for you.~
@1164 = ~There was an... incident, once.  Two bandits came upon me as I slept, and I... did not wake as quickly as I should have. I was barely sixteen then, so they thought they could do whatever they wished.~
@1165 = ~They were mistaken.  I broke their legs.  I do not think they made it home.~
@1166 = ~You sound cold.~
@1167 = ~You did what you had to, I suppose.~
@1168 = ~I wish I could have been there to protect you.  Sixteen is far too young to have to defend yourself in such a brutal way.~
@1169 = ~I am surprised Arundel let you travel alone at sixteen.~
@1170 = ~You do not need to feel protective, <CHARNAME>: even at sixteen, I was formidable.  Arundel knew this.  He never would have let me out of Kuldahar on my own otherwise.~
@1171 = ~These bandits... I was not their first victim.  They must have left other girls... other bodies... in the snow.  I could not let them do it again.~
@1172 = ~But for a moment I felt very vulnerable. In darkness, in the snow, half-dressed, with two armed men upon me - if not for my training and my will, I'd be dead or broken, because fear was very close.  It nearly paralyzed me, overwhelmed me... but I remembered Arundel's words, my prayers, and felt at peace.  And my skills took over the rest.~
@1173 = ~I probably seem cold to you as I speak, do I?  No, the entire affair affected me deeply - and, I confess, I wished for a friend beside me on that night.  Even now, years past, I sleep sounder when I know I am not alone - my companions are watching over me.~
@1174 = ~There is no weakness in being vulnerable, Nella.~
@1175 = ~I will protect you.  And I will watch over you as you sleep.~
@1176 = ~Of course we are.  Thank you for trusting me with this.~
@1177 = ~Maybe.  Still, sometimes I feel too weak for my liking.~
@1178 = ~Thank you.  'Tis good to hear.~
@1179 = ~I... would like to be alone, now.  But thank you for asking.~
@1180 = ~You do not need to thank me for treating your wounds, although... I confess, I am pleased.~
@1181 = ~Do you think that I am beautiful?  I doubt it, myself.  I grew up guarding a caravan; I spent years in the forest.  There are likely more beauties in the kings' courts, or in the cities of the South.~
@1182 = ~There might be.  But my heart is given to the North.~
@1183 = ~You are beautiful, Nella.  It is the simple truth.~
@1184 = ~Would you like me to compliment them, instead?~
@1185 = ~So soon?  But the North is beautiful, true.  My heart was given to Kuldahar when I first beheld it.  Years ago... still feels as if it were yesterday.~
@1186 = ~Ah, so you were complimenting me, then?  I thought you were just stating a simple fact, hmm?~
@1187 = ~Don't worry, I was just teasing.  Of course I am pleased, <CHARNAME>.  Thank you.~
@1188 = ~I am hardly the most well-spoken of your companions.  But I will try to be nicer and... softer, if I can.  It is good to make friends, to walk among fellow adventurers, to walk the roads together.~
@1189 = ~And then, of course, I'll have to heal your wounds at the end of the day.~
@1190 = ~Would you like to take a look at my shoulder, by the way?  It is hurting quite badly.~
@1191 = ~And you have a very soft touch.~
@1192 = ~The downsides of adventuring life.  But I'd wish for no other healer but you.~
@1193 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>.  Just stand still for a moment... oh.  I'll have to take off your shirt, and it's cold out here.  Let's wait until we stop for a rest.  I will tend to your shoulder properly, then.~
@1194 = ~I have to warn you, though.  If you are intending to... court me, there is something you should know.~
@1195 = ~Do I have competition?  Is there someone else?~
@1196 = ~Of course, I should have known.  Your heart is not free.~
@1197 = ~Hey, I said no such thing! Yet.~
@1198 = ~Yes? What is it?~
@1199 = ~There is something... someone, but not in the manner you're alluding to.~
@1200 = ~Indeed?  Well, then, I'll say nothing else - for the time being.  Let's go.~
@1201 = ~I want to live in Kuldahar one day.  To protect and nourish it, like Arundel.  To care about the Tree and the people surrounding it.  To greet weary adventurers and ask them for help, perhaps.~
@1202 = ~But most of all, I simply know in my heart that it must be.  Not today, not the next year, not for another thirty years, perhaps - if I live this long.  But one day...~
@1203 = ~Will you want to be there?  We will see.~
@1204 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.  But all my thoughts are of Arundel right now.  I just... I cannot.~
@1205 = ~I know.  Just tell me if there is anything I can do for you, all right?~
@1206 = ~Of course.  But know that I am here.~
@1207 = ~Maybe you want to talk about him?  I will listen for as long as you need me to.~
@1208 = ~Do you know that I've never been in love?  I was too young when I travelled with my parents, and later, in Kuldahar, no one simply felt... right.  The priests and the farmers were much older, and young men passed through Kuldahar and never lingered for more than a day.~
@1209 = ~I talked about it with Arundel once.  He was like a father to me, so I trusted him with everything.~
@1210 = ~He smiled and asked me to wait.  One day, he said, it will simply happen, and the light would fill my heart.~
@1211 = ~It is flooding my heart now.  Not... not romantic love, or passion.  No.  My love for him - my mentor, my friend, my family.  I loved him so much, and now I long to hear his voice again - and nothing happens.~
@1212 = ~Do you understand, <CHARNAME>?  Even if I started feeling something special for someone else, even if there was light stirring in my heart for you, my grief for Arundel would overwhelm it.~
@1213 = ~But you do feel something for me, don't you?  We can overcome it together.~
@1214 = ~I understand.  I will wait, Nella.  For as long as it takes.~
@1215 = ~Here, let me hold you.  You do not need to be strong all the time.~
@1216 = ~(Nella steps into your arms and puts a head on your shoulder.  For a minute, her body relaxes and envelops yours in a rare display of surrender and trust.  You see tears in her eyes, but she hastily blinks them back.)~
@1217 = ~No, I shouldn't let my guard down so.  Not here.  I will become a mess and a liability in battle.~
@1218 = ~But... thank you, <CHARNAME>.  Lead on, and I'll follow.~
@1219 = ~That's an... unexpected thought.  And wonderful, somehow.~
@1220 = ~I've always pictured myself in the depths of the desert.  Or on the distant shores, away from civilization, but in much warmer climes.  You know, my parents took me all over the Dale, but I'd love to see Baldur's Gate, Athkatla, Neverwinter...~
@1221 = ~With you.  To talk to, to exchange tales, to fall asleep in the same room...~
@1222 = ~I like that last bit.  Could you repeat it again?~
@1223 = ~Did you mean what I think you meant?~
@1224 = ~Sounds wonderful indeed.  I am tempted to book passage on a ship as soon as we're out of here.~
@1225 = ~Oh.  When I said we'd fall asleep in the same room, I didn't mean... I...~
@1226 = ~Now I am flustered and probably red in the face, too!  This is all your fault, <CHARNAME>!~
@1227 = ~Mine?  What did I say?~
@1228 = ~Well, I could sleep on the rag near the door, I suppose.~
@1229 = ~No making love on Waterdhavian rooftops, then?  Figures.  Just my luck.~
@1230 = ~You... you tempted me into it, that's what you did!~
@1231 = ~Oh... don't make me laugh, you!  But, seriously, I am a little angry.  Maybe even more than a little.  You might have meant well, but...~
@1232 = ~For a second there, you made me think that everything was behind me, that I could leave Kuldahar behind, leave this place behind, leave it all!~
@1233 = ~Even Arundel's death was forgotten as I imagined myself climbing a ship's mast.  And now it's all coming back, and the pain is... the pain is...~
@1234 = ~I am sorry.  You've done your best to raise my spirits, and I would like to plan that voyage with you.  In minute detail, with taverns and temple shops, midnight alleys and Grand Ducal holidays, but... everything's too raw yet.  I probably need time.~
@1235 = ~And you have it, Nella.  Always.~
@1236 = ~Of course.  Remember, I'm not pressuring you - we're not a married couple or anything.  Just offered a trip around the world to a girl I like.~
@1237 = ~I understand.  I might need time, too.~
@1238 = ~Good.  Well, then... let's go?~
@1239 = ~And thank you.~
@1240 = ~(Nella blushes slightly and suddenly kisses your cheek.)~
@1241 = ~Oh.  Oh.  For me?~
@1242 = ~These are beautiful!  So slim, and simple, but the craftwork is sublime... and I am going to wear them right now, am I?  Because I really want to.~
@1243 = ~Of course.  Here, let me help you put them on.~
@1244 = ~I am glad you liked them.  I was afraid you'd refuse.~
@1245 = ~Sure!  Do you need a mirror?~
@1246 = ~Would you?  Please.  Just mind the lock, it might be a little tight.~
@1247 = ~I would... I probably should have, but no one ever... I've never received a gift like this before.  And I confess, I liked it very much.  And since you've asked so earnestly, with a clear heart - how could I refuse?~
@1248 = ~Oh, no - there's so much ice around that I probably won't need a real mirror for a long time.~
@1249 = ~Here... all done.  It's a wonderful gift, <CHARNAME>.  It's... well beyond friendship, though.~
@1250 = ~You should think on my next words well.  I do love your gift, but I do not want to put any restraints on you.  We are in a dangerous place, and tomorrow may never come.  Yet I do not feel I am ready for... more... not just now.  If I ask you to wait just a little more, will you?~
@1251 = ~I will.  But if I get a kiss, I won't mind overmuch.~
@1252 = ~Hmm.  I'm getting pretty impatient here, remember.  But since it leaves me free to flirt with everyone, from yeti ladies to pretty barmaids and priestesses of Auril, who am I to complain?~
@1253 = ~You don't need to ask, Nella.  I understand.~
@1254 = ~(Nella approaches you and suddenly kisses you on the mouth without warning - a long, hot, breathless kiss that leaves you two panting, her face flushed and her eyes shining.  She smiles.)~
@1255 = ~And if you are patient...~
@1256 = ~A proper scoundrel, are you?  Well, then, you certainly deserve a punishment.  Or a reminder?..~
@1257 = ~Sometimes.  I think a little bit of everything, these days.  But a concept of family is pleasing, isn't it?  Like a lit fire and a good meal on a rainy day.~
@1258 = ~What about you? Do you think about family, <CHARNAME>?  You'd be a wonderful father.~
@1259 = ~What makes you think that?~
@1260 = ~And you'd be a great mother.  Heh.  Got it?  Druids and the Great Mother?~
@1261 = ~Will I, now?~
@1262 = ~(Nella rolls her eyes, but smiles.)~
@1263 = ~Some fortune-tellers say they can tell what kind of a father a man will be from looking at his hands, but I just need to look in your eyes.  You have very kind eyes.  Especially when you look at me.~
@1264 = ~Do I?  I've never noticed.~
@1265 = ~Because I care about you very deeply.~
@1266 = ~And I love your eyes.  They are like the purest winter sky on a sunny day, but when you look at me, they lit up, and I see that spring is coming.~
@1267 = ~Because you cannot see yourself.  But I can, and I do.  And I... I hope I will.~
@1268 = ~And I... care for you, <CHARNAME>.  You are my closest friend these days.~
@1269 = ~Ever a flatterer.  And I like it.~
@1270 = ~Our journey will be over very soon.  A good time to think of settling down, isn't it?  But I am thinking of new journeys - by your side, if we are blessed with luck.  We druids say that each season comes in time - and my spring is just beginning.~
@1271 = ~Does it mean that you're considering a family, but not yet, not now?~
@1272 = ~I understand.  I often think the same way about myself.~
@1273 = ~May it be a neverending one.~
@1274 = ~There is a time for everything.  To fight, to travel... to love... to hold your firstborn for the first time.~
@1275 = ~I am glad that at this time in my life, I am with you.  I hope it'll last... do you?~
@1276 = ~But enough.  Kuldahar needs us.  Let us go.~
@1277 = ~Say "nonexistent", and you will be correct.  Thankfully, we have Kuldahar.~
@1278 = ~If you stay in the Ten Towns after this is over, I'll show you a true summer.  When I was just a girl, Arundel and I went deep into the forest to pick berries.  I still love the quiet and the slow beauty of it all.  Do you like to pick berries, <CHARNAME>?~
@1279 = ~Bilberries, sure.  Cranberries, not so much - they are sour!~
@1280 = ~Sometimes, if the mood strikes me.~
@1281 = ~It's a nice way to pass the time.~
@1282 = ~I never tried, actually.~
@1283 = ~Not really.~
@1284 = ~I love bilberries, too!  Especially fresh off the bush, while they're still full of juice.~
@1285 = ~Then I am definitely taking you out there!  It will be amazing, you'll see.~
@1286 = ~Then we'll think of something else.  Mushrooms, perhaps?~
@1287 = ~(Nella suddenly laughs.)  Sorry, <CHARNAME>.  I was just teasing.~
@1288 = ~I'd like to see the lands beyond the Spine of the World one day.  A long autumn... an everlasting summer... a true warm spring.  I've even heard that people walk naked in the desert cities - is it true?~
@1289 = ~Some do.  But it's not very practical - the body loses water very quickly in the sun.~
@1290 = ~Mostly the children of the poor.  They don't have enough money for food, let alone clothes.~
@1291 = ~No, everyone has to wear clothes.  Can you imagine naked women just walking around?~
@1292 = ~Of course not.  It is just a rumor.~
@1293 = ~Oh, I see.  It's a question of not having any shelter from the scorching sun, then?  And those who do - they obviously wear proper clothes, right?~
@1294 = ~I thought so.  I would never walk the streets of the city completely bare, no matter how hot it was!~
@1295 = ~Well, maybe on the beach, if I wanted to swim and there was no one else in sight...~
@1296 = ~I hope you'll ask me to keep you company.~
@1297 = ~A tantalizing sight, I am sure.~
@1298 = ~You've never tried swimming before, then?~
@1299 = ~I am sure you are an excellent swimmer, but I would prefer to... bathe separately.  Druids are supposed to discard false modesty, but I must be old-fashioned: I cannot.~
@1300 = ~I did, in Kuldahar's warm springs.  But Lac Dinneshere will kill any swimmer even in high summer.~
@1301 = ~Thank you for indulging my curiosity, <CHARNAME>.  It was... enlightening.~
@1302 = ~Oh.  I thought you wouldn't notice.~
@1303 = ~Why?~
@1304 = ~Do I look this absent-minded?~
@1305 = ~But I did.  So, do I have you to thank for this nice surprise?~
@1306 = ~It's perfectly all right.  Why so flustered, Nella?~
@1307 = ~(sigh) I did not want to get into your things, but the weather was miserable, and with an eastern wind blowing during our journey from Kuldahar, that old seam of yours nearly came undone, and the constant draft through that hole must have been maddening.~
@1308 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>.  I just can't stand to see you shivering.~
@1309 = ~You shouldn't be sorry.  On the contrary, I am very grateful.~
@1310 = ~You could have warned me first, of course, but all is well that ends well.~
@1311 = ~There was no need to trouble yourself.~
@1312 = ~I am very flattered that you care so much.  Thank you.~
@1313 = ~I am glad.  And you feel warmer, I hope?~
@1314 = ~Duly noted - again, I am sorry.  I will ask your permission from now on.~
@1315 = ~Or not at all - seeing how deft your hands are in battle, I'd say you are quite capable of some simple needlework.~
@1316 = ~The winds of the Dale are unpredictable at best, and it always helps to be prepared.  I wanted to go through our party's equipment whenever we have the time - would you like to join me?~
@1317 = ~Darning socks with a beautiful woman?  It could be much worse.~
@1318 = ~Me?  Hey, I am a big strong man!  It's a woman's work!~
@1319 = ~Why not?  Hey, I'd once sewn a button on, too.~
@1320 = ~Naturally.  You'll find that I am quite adept in this.~
@1321 = ~If our companions' well-being is involved, how can I refuse?~
@1322 = ~I'll take it as a "yes", then.~
@1323 = ~And these smart and gentle words firmly buy you a place by my side for an entire evening.~
@1324 = ~Come.  We still have much to do before the night falls.~
@1325 = ~I would like that.  A cup of hot milk near a fire - my mother's cure from all the worries.  Too bad I can't tell her that it actually helps.  But she probably knows already.~
@1326 = ~I have some milk in my pack, and a healthy dose of honey.  Shall I heat it up?~
@1327 = ~I'd like that.  We deserve a small break, I think.~
@1328 = ~Yes, please.~
@1329 = ~No milk for me, but I'll keep you company.~
@1330 = ~Were you close with your mother?~
@1331 = ~No, not especially.  She had other things on her mind, and I probably was not the best daughter, either.  But this is a conversation for another time.~
@1332 = ~I feel cold.  With Arundel gone, the sun's gone, too.  But it feels good to warm the body a little, even if the soul is frozen.~
@1333 = ~Thank you for sitting here with me.  Tell me, <CHARNAME>... were there any rituals in your family, when someone was sick, or hurt, or just sad and tired?~
@1334 = ~We must have, but I don't remember them now.~
@1335 = ~Hugs, usually.  And "everything will be all right".~
@1336 = ~My mother brought me something tasty and stroked my hair.~
@1337 = ~I didn't have much in the way of family.~
@1338 = ~There weren't any, I'm afraid.~
@1339 = ~A pity.  But I'm not sorry I asked.  Your face becomes deeper, warmer, when you remember.~
@1340 = ~I like that.  I think this is what we are doing right now, in a way, no?  Holding each other figuratively, drinking sweet milk and trying to reassure each other that there will be a sunrise.~
@1341 = ~(Nella moves closer and puts an arm around you.)~
@1342 = ~In many ways, you are my family now.  You talk to me, comfort me, share your thoughts with me.  I find peace with you, like I would in the arms of a friend, brother, lover.  And I am thankful, <CHARNAME>.  Very.~
@1343 = ~When I look into your eyes, I want to believe that a day will come when my soul heals.~
@1344 = ~I would like to hope so, too.~
@1345 = ~And I will be by your side when it happens.~
@1346 = ~It will heal.  And we will rejoice together.~
@1347 = ~I know it will.~
@1348 = ~I am very sorry for Arundel's loss.  I can only hope that time will help.~
@1349 = ~Arundel... he never invented any words for loss and sadness.  He simply was there.  And that's what you do now, too, isn't it?  You are here.~
@1350 = ~But it is time to go.  You are our leader, and there are others who need your help, as well.~
@1351 = ~My parents sold me to the druids of Kuldahar, <CHARNAME>.  You can safely imagine I want as little to do with them as possible.~
@1352 = ~They were not bad people, just... businesslike.  A little rough, maybe.  And my first escape to the Tree when I was eleven didn't go unnoticed and unpunished, either.  They knew I had little love for them - could they find any warmth for me in return?~
@1353 = ~It sounds like you had some tough times with your family.~
@1354 = ~Didn't you try to mend your relationship?~
@1355 = ~Of course!  They are your parents, and you are their daughter!~
@1356 = ~We had good times, too.  Mother could be warm and gentle, and even father once spent a fortune for a box of fireworks for my birthday.  Although it turned out they were for another girl in a mansion south of Lonelywood... but for an entire day, I believed in the dream.~
@1357 = ~I was too small to even understand what it meant.  And later I could only think about the druids and my new home.  Perhaps I made a mistake, but correcting it would bring too much pain into our lives now.~
@1358 = ~Indeed.  And we hurt each other as only family could.~
@1359 = ~I do not know what I'd do if I had a child and she'd reject me, like I rejected my own parents.  Family is ever a double-edged sword, isn't it?  And not every child can find her Arundel.~
@1360 = ~I had a childhood with him.  A very short one, since I was already fifteen, but we walked every path of the surrounding forests and vales together, ran to the hot springs, laughed and talked without a care in the world.  He always had time for me... always listened.~
@1361 = ~I miss him.  I will always miss him.  And I will miss you when you go.  You deserve to know.~
@1362 = ~We don't have to miss each other.  There will be other adventures - together.~
@1363 = ~"When" I go?  How about "if"?~
@1364 = ~I will miss you, too.~
@1365 = ~No; listen, here is what I meant to say.~
@1366 = ~There will come a day when we part, I feel it.  Maybe it will be a short separation - you'll journey to the nearest town for supplies, or I will leave your side to help out my brethren with druidic rites.  Maybe you or I will leave the Dale and meet again years hence.  Maybe... it will be permanent.~
@1367 = ~But whatever it is going to be, I will miss your presence when you are not by my side.  Your smile, your jokes, your manner to shield your eyes from the wind and snow.~
@1368 = ~This is what I meant.  And this is what I will always say to you when you return: welcome back.~
@1369 = ~It must have been an amazing moment.  Such a pity that I missed it - but obviously I was meant to.~
@1370 = ~Do you have trouble sleeping?  I have some draughts, if you are in need.~
@1371 = ~No, it's fine.  I just admired the scenery - and you.~
@1372 = ~I was watching you because of you, Nella.  Not because I couldn't sleep.~
@1373 = ~It was my turn to guard the camp, so I had to be awake.~
@1374 = ~That would be nice, thanks.~
@1375 = ~Here, then.  Sleep well tonight.~
@1376 = ~Ah.  I blundered, then.  Well, 'tis your fault for confusing me!~
@1377 = ~Ahh... <CHARNAME>, don't tell anyone, but I have a secret: sometimes I, too, watch you sleep.~
@1378 = ~You have a hard face, a strong face, but when you close your eyes, you are at peace.  And in such moments, I am willing to do anything to see this peace last.~
@1379 = ~You want to put me to eternal sleep, then?  A lovely idea indeed.~
@1380 = ~Anything?  There are some improper things I may ask of you, you know.~
@1381 = ~Well, they say you sleep better with a beautiful woman in your bed...~
@1382 = ~So, you watch me sleep, too?  We are more alike than I thought.~
@1383 = ~Thank you, Nella.  I am touched.~
@1384 = ~Of course not!  I...~
@1385 = ~Oh.  You were teasing me, I see.  Well, you succeeded.~
@1386 = ~<CHARNAME>... are you serious?  Because I may take you up on that offer, and what will you do?~
@1387 = ~(Nella laughs softly.)~
@1388 = ~A fine pair we are, aren't we?  Watching each other sleep and never...~
@1389 = ~But maybe one night we'll wake up at the same time and look into each other's eyes?~
@1390 = ~Thank you.  He had always been proud of me.  I thought I did not deserve his praise, but then Arundel's words would make me feel as if I had wings, and my new task would be done twice as quickly.~
@1391 = ~He made me fly.  As sometimes do you.~
@1392 = ~Remember when we saw the drow for the first time?  I was frightened, confused, but I looked into your eyes - and felt safe.  As if you told me without words that I'd never fail.~
@1393 = ~Really?  And I was just thinking about yesterday's dinner.~
@1394 = ~I don't remember, but I am glad I could help.~
@1395 = ~And you smiled, and I felt the same.~
@1396 = ~Am I becoming an Arundel-like figure to you?~
@1397 = ~Funny.  Maybe because Severn was cooking?~
@1398 = ~When my back is against the wall, you are ever at my side.~
@1399 = ~You are not Arundel to me, <CHARNAME>.  For once, I never wanted to...~
@1400 = ~(She colors suddenly.)~
@1401 = ~We should not speak of such things.  I am sorry, my friend.~
@1402 = ~Nella, I'm not just your friend, right?  So tell me.~
@1403 = ~And it just started getting interesting...~
@1404 = ~Never wanted to - what?~
@1405 = ~As you wish, then.~
@1406 = ~I... no.  <CHARNAME>, a battle is ahead, and I am afraid for you.  If you focus on me, on what I am about to say, it will be unfair - not just to you and me, but to our companions, to the folk of Kuldahar.~
@1407 = ~We will talk.  I'll feel your lips on mine, hold you and whisper all you want me to hear - if you want me to.  But the time has not come yet.~
@1408 = ~Whoever got this idea into your head really deserves a long, patient talk.  But since you are by my side, and the final battle is soon - I'll not complain.  Much.~
@1409 = ~When will it come, then?~
@1410 = ~It better come soon, that's all I am saying.~
@1411 = ~All right.  I understand, Nella.~
@1412 = ~Yes... thank you.~
@1413 = ~Wait with me, <CHARNAME>.  For I'll be waiting.~
@1414 = ~Not especially.  I was too busy robbing people, you see.  Flashing them my cleavage or swinging my hips seductively was... well, not my line of business.  You tend to get noticed this way.~
@1415 = ~Heh. There was that mansion in the Bridge district, the enchanted one - you could only get in if you had a rogue stone.  Each of those cost a fortune.  So... I hid in the shadows and waited for the occupant of the building to appear - a mage, and a handsome one.  I never quite managed the trick of pickpocketing him before he stepped through the portal, though.  Too quick.~
@1416 = ~Other than him... nope, not especially.  I probably didn't look too good: too hungry most of the time.~
@1417 = ~Their loss, my gain.  Your figure looks just perfect, by the way.~
@1418 = ~So, you weren't that good at thievery, then?~
@1419 = ~I am glad nobody tried to do anything unsavory to you, at least.~
@1420 = ~Heh.  I didn't eat too well on the ship, either.  I'm planning to rectify that, so if you're dreaming of cutting your losses by saving on my food, forget it.  Our rations will probably cost you a small fortune, *especially* if I come across some black chocolate.~
@1421 = ~Hey!  Show some respect for my craft!  Or do you have a wide choice of helpers when a locked and trapped chest is waving at you?~
@1422 = ~I didn't think so.~
@1423 = ~Well... no, but I slept in the graveyard most of the time.  It was quiet, empty, and the undead never hogged my blankets.  Kidding.  I never stepped inside the crypts.  There are spiders there, they say.~
@1424 = ~It's odd, isn't it?  I was young, able, beautiful, but I spent most of my breathtaking career in Athkatla hiding and searching for food.  Strange how I'm much more comfortable here, with you and the others.~
@1425 = ~This is your cue to say how happy you are to have me around.  Just giving friendly advice.~
@1426 = ~Very modest advice, I see.~
@1427 = ~I am happy to have you around.  And no, I'm not just saying that.~
@1428 = ~We'll see.  For now, you do not hold your own in battle, and your other skills are substandard at best.~
@1429 = ~WHAT?  Substandard?  Ha!  I'd like to see what you do when a yeti jumps at you and there's no one in sight to backstab him, Mr I-Can-Do-Everything-Myself!  Then again, if I were about to backstab a yeti, you definitely wouldn't see me.~
@1430 = ~I like you, <CHARNAME>.  Simple as that.  And, yep, I like to be liked in return.~
@1431 = ~I miss the prince sometimes, though.  He was an all right sort of fellow, I guess, even if I only met him once.  If only I didn't blunder so completely the last time, we could still duel... hide... whatever.  Or at least I could've washed my hair before being captured.~
@1432 = ~Anyway, I am glad that I am here now.  Maybe doing good things and saving the world once in a while isn't overrated, eh?~
@1433 = ~Absolutely.  Lead on.~
@1434 = ~Maybe it is.  Let's see what the future brings.~
@1435 = ~It still seems boring from time to time.  But I am willing to give it a try.~
@1436 = ~Not with you by my side.~
@1437 = ~Right!  Let's go adventure!~
@1438 = ~Sure thing!  You'd be lost without me, plain and simple.  Although... I may be lost without you, too.  Not that tough in hand-to-claw combat, me.~
@1439 = ~Well, I'm not that tough, either.~
@1440 = ~We'll survive together, Teri.~
@1441 = ~You're doing just fine, I think.~
@1442 = ~Compliments, compliments.  But... I appreciate it, <CHARNAME>.  I've had adventuring companions before, but we've never been like you and I and the others are - a group of friends, almost an extended family.  Just doing a mission together and fighting over loot afterwards.~
@1443 = ~I admit, I like it better your way.  Maybe it's because of your leadership skills and charisma?  I don't know.  But it feels good to fight for a friend.  With a friend.~
@1444 = ~Perhaps more than a friend, one day?~
@1445 = ~It is.  I'd fight for you any day.~
@1446 = ~It feels even better not to fight at all... but we have to.~
@1447 = ~I... I don't know.  Would you say such a thing if you didn't mean it?  I don't know you so well yet.~
@1448 = ~Same here.  Any day, any hour - if it keeps my friends alive.~
@1449 = ~Don't you die on me, by the way.  I have a perfect record of zero companions dying forever.  Well, maybe that's because I had exactly zero permanent companions before, but still.  Please?  Stay alive for me.~
@1450 = ~Only if you promise to do the same.~
@1451 = ~Oh, I will.  Can't promise the same to my enemies, though: heads will roll.~
@1452 = ~Who knows?  We'll see whom fortune favors.~
@1453 = ~It's a deal, then!  Here, I think I still have some Easthaven mead in my flask - have some on me.~
@1454 = ~Of that I have no doubt.  You are really... impressive in battle, do you know that?  Eyes shining, arms flexing, that sort of thing.~
@1455 = ~And... <CHARNAME>?  Your smile makes me feel less bored, too.~
@1456 = ~Not that it's the greatest compliment ever.  But you know what I mean.~
@1457 = ~That's a good question.  But I'm afraid it's not a very good story.~
@1458 = ~Let me be the judge of that.~
@1459 = ~I'm still willing to hear it, if you'd like to tell.~
@1460 = ~I... (sigh) You see, you and me, we met like true adventurers do.  An expedition, saving the world, fighting goblins and exploring caves.~
@1461 = ~With my parents, it's been different.~
@1462 = ~Mother was a farmer's daughter.  She lived a simple, quiet life - nothing glamorous or exciting.  Obviously, there wasn't an abundance of suitors on the farm, and she happily lived to twenty-six or so without... well, without anything much in that department.  You know what I mean.~
@1463 = ~How did she meet your father, then?~
@1464 = ~But she is a well-known adventurer now, no?~
@1465 = ~Why didn't she stay on the farm?  It sounds like a good, solid life.  I might even prefer it.~
@1466 = ~She is... but the road was rockier than you'd expect.~
@1467 = ~You?  Ha!  You'd grow bored within a month!  But I agree, it sounds like a nice life.  Alas, my mother didn't have a choice.~
@1468 = ~My mother's farm was on the way to Daggerford, so my father passed it on his way.  He was a wandering spirit, who lost his family early... I think.  He never spoke of them much.~
@1469 = ~So, it was the most banal story for my mother: a strange elf wandered through their land, saw her near the well and asked her for a drink of water.  She invited him to stay for dinner... which never came: during that very night, bandits attacked the farm and burned it to the ground.  Simpler than simple.~
@1470 = ~I am so sorry, Teri.~
@1471 = ~(Put an arm around her shoulders)~
@1472 = ~What happened then?  Were your parents hurt?~
@1473 = ~(Teri leans on you gratefully.)~
@1474 = ~My father's skill with a blade was good for something, at least.  He drove the bandits off in the end, and managed to protect my mother from harm.  But the farm lay in ruins, and my mother's family... gone.~
@1475 = ~She had no choice but to develop her skill in divine magic and do some mercenary work in Daggerford with my father, who never left her side afterwards.  They got married very quickly and quietly, too.~
@1476 = ~They love each other, I know.  But their tale didn't have a very nice start.~
@1477 = ~Maybe ours will be better.~
@1478 = ~They are alive.  That's what is important.~
@1479 = ~I am very happy they survived and got married.  Otherwise you wouldn't be standing by my side.~
@1480 = ~Ours?  My, but whatever do you mean, good sir?  Should I be worried that my innocence is in danger?  Heheheh.~
@1481 = ~I love my parents.  But I often wonder if good things are only born of terrible things.  After all, you and I met on an expedition where everyone else but our party died.  And Arundel sacrificed himself.  And... and others will, I think.~
@1482 = ~Maybe.  But I won't let anyone hurt you.~
@1483 = ~Hey.  Listen: everything will be all right.~
@1484 = ~It might even be me, I'm afraid.~
@1485 = ~(sigh) I just hope my parents won't have to sacrifice anything else.  Not anymore.  And... I don't want to lose you, either.  So, in case you want to sacrifice yourself, just give me the dagger.  I'll do it good and proper!~
@1486 = ~(Teri winks.)  Kidding.  Now, let's go!  If we want a happy ending to *our* tale, we'll need to work for it.~
@1487 = ~What?  Chocolate?  And you kept silent ALL THIS TIME!  You're an evil, wicked, scheming and manipulating man, you are!~
@1488 = ~(Without warning, she jumps straight into your arms.)  And I like you.  Now, how about that chocolate?  I have a sudden premonition it's got to go by the next sunset, or terrible things will happen.~
@1489 = ~Terrible things, really?  Like a certain rogue stuffing herself with said chocolate?~
@1490 = ~Indeed?  What things would those be?~
@1491 = ~Well, we can't have that, can we?  Here you go.~
@1492 = ~Right.  Terrible things.  Like you tickling me to death?~
@1493 = ~I sense disrespect in your words, young adventurer.  A horrible punishment may be forthcoming!~
@1494 = ~Mmm!  Mmghp - grumph - mmmgh - MMM!  It's really GOOD!  And it's all MINE!~
@1495 = ~(Teri hugs you even tighter.)~
@1496 = ~<CHARNAME>, you are the bestest <CHARNAME> ever, and you can tell everyone I said so.~
@1497 = ~As long as it makes you happy.~
@1498 = ~I am glad you liked it.~
@1499 = ~It's widely known news, you know.  I am simply that awesome.~
@1500 = ~Yes!  Fear my tickling attacks, mortal!  Great Teriel Gilethir is going to concentrate her might and magic upon you!  No one will come away unscathed!~
@1501 = ~Aaagh!  I surrender!  Here, you can have the chocolate, but leave my ribs alone!~
@1502 = ~Heheh!  I'm not ticklish!  But you can have the chocolate, Teri.  It is all for you, after all.~
@1503 = ~Wait.  Wait.  It wasn't a tickling attack, was it?  You little imp!  You stole the chocolate!~
@1504 = ~Funny how a single piece of chocolate can keep you warm all day.  Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1505 = ~(She carelessly ruffles your hair and leaves your arms, but you can see that Teri is genuinely touched.)~
@1506 = ~Hmm.  Let me touch your forehead, first.~
@1507 = ~... It *is* hot!  Hey, you're positively feverish!  We must get you to a warm bed as soon as possible.~
@1508 = ~... Except that you'd start dreaming of me again, and now that I know about it, I'll be embarrassed.  Hmm.  I see no good outcome here.  Either you're getting sick, or you're seeing naughty dreams of me.  How naughty, by the way?~
@1509 = ~Let's just say no clothes are involved.~
@1510 = ~Well, we are in bed, together, and...~
@1511 = ~Oh, not at all.  You're just picking flowers... er, on the meadow.  Yes, that's right.~
@1512 = ~None?  No laced lingerie, no silk stockings, no... nothing?  My, <CHARNAME>, your imagination must be running a fever, too, to be so plain.  Ahem, that is, I meant...~
@1513 = ~We're sleeping?  Tell me we're just sleeping.~
@1514 = ~Uh-huh.~
@1515 = ~I had a naughty dream about you, once.  Only it was about you stealing cheese from my backpack late at night when no one was looking.  It was damn good cheese, too.~
@1516 = ~See?  I've got taste!~
@1517 = ~What, that's it?  No romantic tension, no kisses, no shed clothes?~
@1518 = ~I seem to recall a certain rogue did get into MY backpack, and the following morning, the entire supply of Kuldahar cream cheese went missing.~
@1519 = ~Actually, it wasn't a dream.~
@1520 = ~So you do.  In... cheese, at least.~
@1521 = ~Oh.  Do you mean that you only eat cheese while sitting naked in the moonlight?  I must have woken up and missed all the interesting bits, then.~
@1522 = ~Lies and slander!  Never would I eat any cream cheese without sharing it with... erm... myself? (sigh)  Damn it.  And I thought I was so stealthy, too.~
@1523 = ~O-ho!  Caught in the act!  So, who's naughty now?~
@1524 = ~But seriously, you might want to wait with all this dreaming until we save the world.  You need all your strength and focus, and all that.  Although a part of me is... (cough)~
@1525 = ~A part of you is - what?~
@1526 = ~You don't want to wait?~
@1527 = ~Of course.  But once the bastard is dead, I'm going to put my efforts towards making some of these dreams a reality!~
@1528 = ~You just wait, Teri.  You will be mine.~
@1529 = ~(Teri suddenly blushes crimson and walks away, steadily avoiding your gaze for the next hour.)~
@1530 = ~Sure!  Let's discuss the menu.  I want a fried chicken.  No, two.  And fried rice with an egg or three.  And maybe some pineapple sauce.~
@1531 = ~Anything you want, Teri.  As long as you're there with me.~
@1532 = ~I don't think the menu is that important.  I just want some quality time alone.~
@1533 = ~It sounds great.  Although I always appreciate a good steak.~
@1534 = ~And wine.  Don't forget the wine.~
@1535 = ~(Teri sighs happily.)  I think it's the best idea I heard in months.  Although I doubt there're good restaurants in Kuldahar...  I may even have to cook, and *then* we'll all die for sure!~
@1536 = ~Anyway.  I am so glad that here, at the end of the road, you're still with me.  Near me.  Well, you know what I want to say.~
@1537 = ~I do.  And I treasure your company.  Always.~
@1538 = ~I don't, but it doesn't matter.  You look nice when you talk enthusiastically.~
@1539 = ~(Kiss her)~
@1540 = ~(Teri smiles impishly... and suddenly leans in and kisses you.)~
@1541 = ~(Her lips are warm and waiting, and her body practically melts into you, as her arms fly over your neck.  A small moan escapes Teri's lips, and she smiles without breaking the kiss.  For a full minute, you have a happy half-elven rogue in your arms, small, content, and completely unwilling to let go.)~
@1542 = ~This... this was nice.  Really.~
@1543 = ~It was.~
@1544 = ~Very much so.  I'm looking forward to a repeat performance, actually.~
@1545 = ~Told you: I'm awesome.~
@1546 = ~More than nice, maybe.  We'll talk?  Soon?~
@1547 = ~(With a sigh, Teri presses your hand against her cheek for a moment, and finally escapes your arms.)~
@1548 = ~Oh, it's nothing.  A stone landed on my head.  Rather harshly, too.  I bet he wasn't a gentleman.~
@1549 = ~We need to heal you.~
@1550 = ~Let me take a look.~
@1551 = ~Naturally.  To hit such a beauty on the head!~
@1552 = ~Well, the offending mineral is buried under the avalanche now.  But I like the way you think.~
@1553 = ~I'll be all right, <CHARNAME>.  Food and sleep and shelter - that's all I need right now.  Except not, of course: until we figure out this Kuldahar business, no rest is coming, eh?~
@1554 = ~Ahhh, never mind.  We'll survive.  We *are* survivors, aren't we?~
@1555 = ~We are.  I am very glad you are alive, Teri.~
@1556 = ~We survived the avalanche, so I suppose we are.~
@1557 = ~If you need healing later, please, tell me.~
@1558 = ~Oh!  By the way.  Here.  Some Easthaven mead to keep you warm - I have two full flasks.  Will you share a drink with me?~
@1559 = ~Sure.  Bring it on!~
@1560 = ~With pleasure.~
@1561 = ~Not right now.~
@1562 = ~Here you go, then.  To victory - and to being absolutely awesome adventurers!~
@1563 = ~Suit yourself.  These flasks are going to become empty very soon, that's all I'm saying!~
@1564 = ~And thanks.  For... caring.  You know.~
@1565 = ~I like my nose too!  Wait, it was a compliment, was it?  Darn, I miss everything good.~
@1566 = ~Are there any other parts of my body you'd like to favorably comment on?  Go on, I'm listening!  Favorably, mind: if my ears are less than perfect, I don't want to know.~
@1567 = ~They are very nice, by the way.  Round-ish and elfish at the same time.~
@1568 = ~I like your eyes, too.  And your hair.  You are a beautiful girl, Teri.~
@1569 = ~I wonder how your breasts look under that armor.  They got to be perky, right?~
@1570 = ~You do have a nice, slim figure...~
@1571 = ~You are... pretty?~
@1572 = ~I wanted a pair of elven ears when I was little.  Then my father killed a few elven bandits, and brought, um, their ears home - he had to show them to the magistrate, but the hour was late.~
@1573 = ~Naturally, little Teri went to have a look.  Needless to say, I had little desire to have real elven ears after that.~
@1574 = ~It's strange: my mother and father looked so different that I never had a canon of beauty in my head as I grew up.  Should my hair be lighter in tone, like my mother's?  But father's is much darker, and he's handsome, too.  Should my figure be slim and slight?  But mother's is curvy, and men watch her in awe when she passes by.~
@1575 = ~Elven and human, and I'm in the middle.  It never bothered me, I just... wonder.  Sometimes.~
@1576 = ~But I'm sorry.  I am probably boring you.  Say, can I pay you a compliment?~
@1577 = ~Go on.~
@1578 = ~Of course, Teri.~
@1579 = ~As long as you're honest.~
@1580 = ~Works for me!  Life is short, and an extra compliment won't hurt.  Right?~
@1581 = ~Hmm, do you think I should pretend to be shocked or give you an actual peek?  No, no, don't answer: I have an inkling which you are going to choose.~
@1582 = ~I like your forehead.  Each time I look at it, I am tempted to read your thoughts.  I know I can't, obviously, but I still want to... and I feel like half the time they'll be about me.~
@1583 = ~And I like your hands, too, though I can see little through gloves and mittens.  But you're a handsome man, <CHARNAME>.  Don't let it spoil you.~
@1584 = ~Why would you say such a thing?~
@1585 = ~Thank you.  I had no idea you paid that much attention to my looks.~
@1586 = ~You are not falling in love with me, are you?~
@1587 = ~Hmm?  Oh, no reason.  I just like to sound omniscient.  (sigh) Although I probably sounded lecturing, did I?  Sorry.~
@1588 = ~I like you.  Like a friend.  Yep, seems about right.~
@1589 = ~And, remember, friends get chocolate!~
@1590 = ~Right.  Like a girl would confess first.  Dream on, Mr Let's-Crawl-Through-Every-Cave-In-Existence!~
@1591 = ~Because nothing ever comes of it for you, you mean?  No payoff and all?  Heheh.~
@1592 = ~Hey!~
@1593 = ~I didn't say that.~
@1594 = ~I was just curious, Teri.~
@1595 = ~Well, my bedroll is always open, if you know what I mean.~
@1596 = ~Too bad.  It's pretty cold outside.  You could get a nasty cough.~
@1597 = ~I... don't know why I always sleep next to you.  Not because I *want* to sleep with you, if you know what I mean.  But it feels safer.  Nicer.  (sigh) Not warmer, though.~
@1598 = ~I like your company, too, by the way.~
@1599 = ~I will always protect you, Teri.~
@1600 = ~You can sleep whenever you like, you know this.  Not just next to me.~
@1601 = ~Are you completely sure you don't want to get inside my bedroll?~
@1602 = ~Oh, I'll move if you aren't comfortable.  Sorry.  But I appreciate you didn't lash out.~
@1603 = ~Thanks.  That's nice to hear.  Do say these things from time to time - I always melt like a little girl.~
@1604 = ~No.  But we all have dreams that won't come true right away, right?~
@1605 = ~It's nice of you to have me around.  Not to push your bedroll to the other side of the camp, or, I don't know, run away screaming.  Thanks for that.~
@1606 = ~I sense a story here.  Did someone else run away screaming?~
@1607 = ~Is there something you're not telling me?~
@1608 = ~Why, though?  Are you afraid to fall asleep when you're on your own?~
@1609 = ~Oh, it's nothing.  When I was little, I always slept near my father's bedroll, when we were in the wilderness together.  Mother once tactfully hinted that one day, she and my father won't be near, so I'd *have* to sleep on my own, but I didn't listen to her then.  And I really should have.~
@1610 = ~(sigh)  I'm sorry if it seemed like I was stalking you.  I wasn't, honestly.  But out of all these monsters, skeletons and villains you seem to be the biggest, baddest of them all.  Or maybe just the sanest one.  So I feel safest with you.~
@1611 = ~Come on, let's go before I embarrass myself even further.  I do want to be able to look you in the eye, you know.~
@1612 = ~You?  Ha!  I could teach *you*, if I wanted!~
@1613 = ~Really?  And how much experience do you have?~
@1614 = ~Why don't I believe you?~
@1615 = ~Seriously, did you ever kiss anyone before?~
@1616 = ~Hmph.  All right, I may have *less* experience than you do, but it doesn't mean I never... ever...  And I did!  More than twice, if you want to know.~
@1617 = ~Does it mean that your kiss count is at the astonishing number of three?~
@1618 = ~Thrice, then?~
@1619 = ~Indeed?  Very interesting.~
@1620 = ~My offer still stands, by the way.~
@1621 = ~Grrr!  <CHARNAME>, wipe that satisfied, aggravating, smug and annoying smirk off your face!  I am *not* going to kiss you.  Ever!  Not today, tomorrow, and even... even next month!  So there.~
@1622 = ~Oh, I'll wait.~
@1623 = ~You won't be able to resist me.  I am that awesome.~
@1624 = ~You are very pretty when you growl like that.~
@1625 = ~Whatever.~
@1626 = ~All right, all right.  Message received.~
@1627 = ~(grumble) Keep it up, and I'll bite you.  And *then* there'll be no kissing whatsoever.  Unless, of course, herbs and cold compresses do their job quickly.~
@1628 = ~You'd be so cruel as to bite these lips?  But they speak of naught but true love for you!~
@1629 = ~And you don't have the slightest desire to meet your lips with mine?  Kiss the corner of my mouth?  I don't believe you.~
@1630 = ~And your number of kisses will forever stay at the count of three.~
@1631 = ~Very well, then.  I'll leave you alone.~
@1632 = ~Good.  Hmm.  Or not?~
@1633 = ~(sigh) With you, I don't know anything anymore.~
@1634 = ~GRRRR!!!~
@1635 = ~(Teri gives you a strange blazing wild look and her hot breath is suddenly on your face, as her mouth melds with yours.  Her eyes are screwed tight, but a smile slowly spreads on her face.)~
@1636 = ~(At last she opens her eyes and steps back, breathless.)~
@1637 = ~Four.  So there!~
@1638 = ~(She winks at you as she walks away, laughing.)~
@1639 = ~Or maybe a castle!  With a moat and a drawbridge and everything!~
@1640 = ~Or a fur coat.  A fur coat is nice.  Especially here in the Icewind Dale.~
@1641 = ~Or maybe a ship?  We could go to Memnon and free the slaves!  Or do something equally daring, stupid and wonderful.~
@1642 = ~Or... I don't know.  We could help the widows and elderly of Kuldahar, or some such nonsense.  After all, I can always steal myself a pearl necklace or two later.~
@1643 = ~You were half-starved when you arrived in Icewind Dale, remember?  Stealing may not work so well.~
@1644 = ~I still want a house.  Maybe a dog, too.~
@1645 = ~Well, we have a *lot* of loot.  We may be able to afford all of it.~
@1646 = ~Freeing the slaves, Teri?  Doesn't sound like you.~
@1647 = ~And he is doubting me again, I see.  Shame on you, <CHARNAME>!  By the way, check your jewelry - one of your rings may be missiiiiing!~
@1648 = ~Kidding.  Although you have a point.  Besides, stealing is embarrassing.  Looting dead people is much more convenient!~
@1649 = ~Sure.  I'm a dog person!  Although if we want to take the poor animal adventuring with us, we should start with a dire wolf at the very least.  Maybe a small dragon.~
@1650 = ~And a ship!  Oh, I want a ship!  I am going to steer, and sleep in the crow's nest!  Too bad that pirating is so evil...~
@1651 = ~Well, I do have my moments.  But, yeah, pretty crazy, if you ask me.  Although... why not?  We're adventurers, let us adventure!~
@1652 = ~Anyway, I appreciate the thought.  Won't hold you to your promise, but if you do have money for a ship... a yacht... well, even a small fishing boat will do.~
@1653 = ~I love sailing.  I get seasick, naturally, but I want to overcome it, and I know I will.  Pity Lac Dinneshere is so hopelessly frozen, but we could always return to the Sword Coast.~
@1654 = ~You'd like to adventure with me, then?~
@1655 = ~I am glad you want to stay by my side.~
@1656 = ~The Realms are huge.  We could set sail and go anywhere in the world.~
@1657 = ~Of course!  And with the others, too.~
@1658 = ~It would not be the same without you.  You make things better, somehow.  Not sure *how*, but you do.~
@1659 = ~Magic.~
@1660 = ~Good to hear it.~
@1661 = ~That's because you're in love with me, Teri.~
@1662 = ~That old tune?  Pfft!~
@1663 = ~Come on, let's kill some giants, salamanders and trolls!  We need more loot to buy that ship!~
@1664 = ~Me?  Ha!  All the time!  I nearly decapitated that priestess of Auril because she was staring at you lustfully.  Or maybe she wanted to turn you into an ice statue?  Anyway, a deed well done.~
@1665 = ~Ahem.  That is, I didn't mean that I was ever jealous of anyone who liked you, or jealous because of you, because of anything connected to you, et cetera.~
@1666 = ~Really?  You wound me.~
@1667 = ~Of course, Teri.  I never implied otherwise.~
@1668 = ~So, are you jealous or aren't you jealous when it comes to me?~
@1669 = ~Pfft!  As if!~
@1670 = ~Well... so there.~
@1671 = ~There's nothing to be jealous *of*, right?  We are not married or anything.  You do pay me a lot of attention, but it's not like I can't ride into the sunset with someone else, if I want to.~
@1672 = ~Do you want to?~
@1673 = ~We can make a formal announcement, if you want.~
@1674 = ~But you are uncomfortable when I pay attention to someone else, right?~
@1675 = ~Sometimes.  When you're not around, Mr First-Guy-In-The-Village-Because-He's-The-Only-One-There.~
@1676 = ~Whatever for?  If we don't feel it yet, we shouldn't say it - or we'll have another, much less pleasant announcement to make down the road.~
@1677 = ~I don't know.  Killing people *is* wrong, right?~
@1678 = ~No, I'm sorry.  I am being cruel.  I like you, <CHARNAME>.  A lot.  But... I'm not sure.  Like it's spring, but I'm not sure it's spring yet, do you know the feeling?  And if you're not sure, how can you get jealous?~
@1679 = ~Anyway, don't let it get to your head.  Let's gather the badges and beat the Big Bad.  And then I'll treat you with the Jealousy Scene of the Century, if you still want me to.  Promise!~
@1680 = ~Did you dream of this when you set out from Waterdeep?  Stopping a war, negotiating with a barbarian tribe, becoming a true hero of renown?~
@1681 = ~I want to go on a boat ride with you.  Would you like it?~
@1682 = ~I'm scared, Holvir.  We are trapped - what if we die here?~
@1683 = ~You look better without that heavy cloak.  Lonelywood air agrees with you, doesn't it?~
@1684 = ~You'd have made a fine elven barbarian yourself.~
@1685 = ~So... alone in a romantic mysterious castle lost in the desert.  Any ideas?~
@1686 = ~Lonelywood...  Do you ever wish to leave with the barbarian tribes, Nella?  To be as free as they are?~
@1687 = ~You look happier than you have been in a long time.~
@1688 = ~We are trapped and no mistake.  But I am glad I have you with me.~
@1689 = ~I saw a spring nearby.  We could float toy boats there!~
@1690 = ~I want to ruffle your hair right now.  And you know what?  I am going to do it!~
@1691 = ~I'll get us all out of this cursed castle, I promise.~
@1692 = ~It is pleasing to dream of becoming a hero, but am I one?  We haven't stopped the war yet.~
@1693 = ~But you are right: I never dreamed of an adventure like this, of a journey that goes on and on and brings new wonders every day.  And all of it - by your side...~
@1694 = ~It was your call to agree to Hjollder's plea, and you made the right one.  We can make a difference.~
@1695 = ~And you've gone and become all serious again.~
@1696 = ~I know.  I am wise, beautiful, and I always make right decisions!~
@1697 = ~So we can.  And then we *will* become heroes of renown!~
@1698 = ~I am glad you agree.~
@1699 = ~Someone has to be.  If I suddenly go prancing in the woods, you will have to assume my place, and who'll let you have levity then?~
@1700 = ~When your smile shines so brightly, I will agree with anything you say.  Although that... wasn't the best admission, was it?~
@1701 = ~A legend is unraveling around us.  And we are not idle bystanders - nay, we are in the center of it.  One day minstrels will sing of you... of me.~
@1702 = ~Or of you and me?~
@1703 = ~Doesn't the thought please you?~
@1704 = ~Sounds good to me!~
@1705 = ~Naturally, since we adventure together.  Or did your words have another meaning?~
@1706 = ~I don't feel I have done anything worthy yet.  Perhaps years later, when I see this land healed and hale, I might understand.  But now?  I am but one of many.~
@1707 = ~What about you, lady <CHARNAME>?  Do you feel unique?  Special?~
@1708 = ~When you call me lady <CHARNAME>?  Absolutely.~
@1709 = ~Of course I am!  Do you have any doubt?~
@1710 = ~Sometimes.  Don't you?~
@1711 = ~Not at all.  I am just me.~
@1712 = ~I must remember to do it more often, then.  All the more so because it brings me joy.~
@1713 = ~(Holvir smiles.)~
@1714 = ~I suppose we all feel special from time to time, regardless of the journey.  Climbing a mountain peak, helping a friend, solving a mystery, falling in love...~
@1715 = ~And the latter is the most special feeling of all... is it not?~
@1716 = ~It would be my pleasure.  I learnt to row in Waterdeep when I was a boy, but it's not a skill easily forgotten.~
@1717 = ~Maer Dualdon is still at this time of year, but the lake's waters are bitterly cold and perilous.  If we go on a ride, I trust you'll be careful?~
@1718 = ~Of course.  But you'll protect me, won't you?~
@1719 = ~You speak like we're going on a deadly mission, not a pleasure cruise!~
@1720 = ~No need.  I know I am safe with you.~
@1721 = ~With my life, if need be.  But do you want me to resort to such drastic measures?~
@1722 = ~And you always will be.  But my heart will feel much lighter if you take my warnings to heart, too.~
@1723 = ~We are on a deadly mission, my dear friend.  I regret that I have to remind you, but even when we are enjoying each other's company, peril is ahead.~
@1724 = ~Although I can't see why would anyone want to hurt you.  I imagine you in a boat, calm and relaxed, looking at me through your eyelashes, sun shining in your hair... Any sane being would want to draw the sight, not destroy it.~
@1725 = ~I like the way your imagination works.~
@1726 = ~Can you draw, Holvir?~
@1727 = ~The undead don't have any appreciation for true art, I fear.~
@1728 = ~Tell it to Wylfdene's people.~
@1729 = ~My mother gave me lessons, but after that fire... no.  I preferred the sword by far.~
@1730 = ~And I wish to throw a bag over its head sometimes.  I speak figuratively, of course - but the sights like the one I just described are too great a distraction.  In battle or... otherwise.~
@1731 = ~True enough.  Which is why we both should bring weapons - but not armor, or I won't get you out of the water if you fall.~
@1732 = ~All things considered, it will be a rather risky boat ride, won't it?  Icy water, monsters, dangers... But I want to try it with you.  If... you are still willing.~
@1733 = ~I am!~
@1734 = ~More than ever.~
@1735 = ~I am - if you are.~
@1736 = ~Maybe it will be wiser to try it somewhere else.~
@1737 = ~Perhaps another time.~
@1738 = ~I am glad.  It's settled, then.  And should it snow, or rain, or hail - we'll just look at each other and say without hesitation: "Nice day, isn't it?"~
@1739 = ~Indeed.  One day...~
@1740 = ~(Holvir steps up to you at once.)~
@1741 = ~No.  Never, <CHARNAME>.  I won't let my worst enemy die here - and I will do my utmost to save you.~
@1742 = ~Does it mean that I am your worst enemy?~
@1743 = ~You're not scared at all?~
@1744 = ~Thank you.  I hope you're not just saying that.~
@1745 = ~I know you will.~
@1746 = ~You are... what?  Ah, you are teasing me again, I see.~
@1747 = ~No, <CHARNAME>.  For what it's worth, I shall always be on your side.~
@1748 = ~This place holds many dark secrets, but we will be fine, while Tyr's hand guides us.  But you... you never cease to amaze me.~
@1749 = ~I see a strong woman and warrior - and the next moment she is a beautiful, caring friend.  Then a vulnerable, almost frightened young girl - but enemies jump out, and she is a proud, headstrong valkyrie again.~
@1750 = ~You are an enigma, <CHARNAME>.  And there is so much more to learn.  One day you will discover it for yourself - when you become a great heroine, a lover, a mentor... a wife... a mother, perhaps.~
@1751 = ~But I am already a great heroine and a lover... or a beloved?~
@1752 = ~I do not look forward to some of these roles.~
@1753 = ~It would be interesting indeed.~
@1754 = ~There is sadness in your voice.  Why?~
@1755 = ~Perhaps you are beloved, but do you love?~
@1756 = ~And I may never fulfill some of them.  Such is life.~
@1757 = ~This journey will draw to a close one day, and I still do not know what will await us then.  A good future, I hope, but what does it hold?  A victory and a parting of ways?  And a lonely road?~
@1758 = ~Or many journeys with a woman you love.~
@1759 = ~We could just marry and be together, you know.~
@1760 = ~Would you have me as a lover?  If you knew there wouldn't be any children?~
@1761 = ~I know you feel obligated to stay on the road and can't have a family.  But it's not the reason not to have loyal friends beside you.~
@1762 = ~Or camaraderie, adventure and friendship for many more years.~
@1763 = ~And that brings me hope.~
@1764 = ~There is warmth in your eyes... does it mean you're not afraid anymore?  Let us go, then, my friend.  Our future awaits us.~
@1765 = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@1766 = ~We can't be close.  There are herbs and magic, true, but it's not the point - what if something happens? What if I fall in battle and leave you alone?  Or with a child on the way, in a strange land?~
@1767 = ~Perhaps in a year or two I'll realize what an idiot I've been, fall on my knees before you, and we'll have a true family - a hearth and a home we'll keep returning to after our journeys, perhaps even a son or a daughter we'll eagerly spend months with after days and days of dangers.  And perhaps the gods will even spare us, so we'll see our children grow, celebrate a golden wedding and live happily ever after.~
@1768 = ~But will I, in my right mind, ask you to wait all these years?  I do not think so, my lady.  Nor should I.~
@1769 = ~(Holvir kisses your hand and walks away, looking rather distraught and pale.  But there is a new expression in his eyes, an uncertain and almost hopeful one, which could be described by simple words:  "But what if...?")~
@1770 = ~To think that we are supposed to be far north from the Spine of the World.  But it is much warmer here.  And... if I'm not mistaken, you were just admiring my figure?~
@1771 = ~I was, too!~
@1772 = ~It is a fine figure to admire.~
@1773 = ~What?  Me?  Never!~
@1774 = ~Not especially.  Seen one elf, seen them all.~
@1775 = ~I see.  Well, then, I'll try to impress you in some other way, if I think of one.~
@1776 = ~(Korin shakes his head with a smile.)~
@1777 = ~You are going to spoil me one of these days.~
@1778 = ~You look much better in this light, as well.  Even your face looks warmer and softer.~
@1779 = ~As opposed to gritty and hard?~
@1780 = ~And usually I am... cold?~
@1781 = ~Thank you, Korin.~
@1782 = ~A-ha, you noticed!  Next time you'll pretend you're not paying attention, know that I'm seeing right through you!~
@1783 = ~Ah, and I've blundered again.  Congratulations, Korin, you're a true charmer.~
@1784 = ~But to answer you - no.  You're focused.  It is different.~
@1785 = ~And I am discovered, I see.  But I do pay attention, <CHARNAME>.  In some cases... it's impossible not to.~
@1786 = ~Someday, when we go south, to the desert cities of Calimshan - if our adventures ever take us there - we'll be able to discard our winter garb for good.  I'd lie if I said I was not looking forward to find out what you'd wear.~
@1787 = ~A pair of coins on a string and a torn hanky, naturally.~
@1788 = ~And you won't be disappointed.~
@1789 = ~Oooh, so you dream of me, do you?~
@1790 = ~I am not sure it will happen.~
@1791 = ~Keep dreaming, then.~
@1792 = ~We are in the desert, Korin.~
@1793 = ~Obviously.  Why didn't I think of it before?~
@1794 = ~Indeed?  We'll have to hurry with our tasks in the Dale, then.  Suddenly I cannot wait...~
@1795 = ~There's no need to dream - opening one's eyes is enough.  You do have an inspiring grace to you, <CHARNAME>.  It is hard not to notice it.~
@1796 = ~Stranger things have happened - and we're no strangers to strange things, are we?~
@1797 = ~But I will take what I can get - a breath of sun in Lonelywood, your smile - and, of course, more than our share of ice and snow to come.~
@1798 = ~Shall we?~
@1799 = ~True, and nothing could please me less.  But the nights are freezing here.  We'd do well to hold on to our heavy cloaks - and our wits.~
@1800 = ~Come, it's high time we got out of here.~
@1801 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am positively shocked you think so little of my eating habits.  Or is it my unruly hair?~
@1802 = ~A little bit of both?~
@1803 = ~It's your furs and your scowl, actually.~
@1804 = ~Aww, don't you want to lead a tribe?~
@1805 = ~I don't know, it just came to my head.~
@1806 = ~Lovely.  (sigh) If only I had my silken tunics and a decent hairdresser available...~
@1807 = ~... It would be useless, for neither my new hairstyle nor the attire would survive a single skirmish.  But still worth a thought.~
@1808 = ~And you've never seen a smiling barbarian?  My, but we need to broaden your horizons.~
@1809 = ~(His eyes smile at you.)~
@1810 = ~Not unless my life depended on it.  Back in Evereska, I wouldn't have minded to *enslave* a tribe or two, but that's not nearly the same thing, is it?~
@1811 = ~You do have strange fantasies.  Anything else you'd like to share?  I've once been told I'd make a good bard, too.~
@1812 = ~You can sing?~
@1813 = ~Told by whom?~
@1814 = ~I would like to hear you singing.~
@1815 = ~But bards need magic, and you don't have any.~
@1816 = ~Oh, plenty!  Wait, you wanted to be a bard?~
@1817 = ~Oh, I have no singing voice at all: that was the point.  When others chanted spells, I screeched.  Although... even a screech is preferable to nothing.~
@1818 = ~True, but I had magic back then.  Evereska... another life indeed.~
@1819 = ~My mentor told me I needed to exercise my voice, find beauty in chanting each syllable, sing ballads and aubades and whatnot.~
@1820 = ~Obviously, I scoffed at her and went about my business... to the library, as I recall.  And you know what happened next.~
@1821 = ~Perhaps Hanali spoke with her voice, and now she speaks with yours?  And I need to become a barbarian in order to gain my magic back?~
@1822 = ~A very handsome barbarian, too.~
@1823 = ~I was joking, Korin.  You are fine as you are.~
@1824 = ~Korin, that's way too complicated.~
@1825 = ~Sounds like a plan.~
@1826 = ~And your words lift my spirits.  But when it comes to my absent magic, I become bad company, <CHARNAME>.~
@1827 = ~Now who's indulging in idle fantasies?  I am, it seems, and they bring me nothing good.~
@1828 = ~So I'd rather lock my melancholy away from you.  We will talk again, I promise - but later.~
@1829 = ~Getting out of here?~
@1830 = ~You're no fun at all.~
@1831 = ~Obviously, yes, but anything else?~
@1832 = ~Do you have ANY imagination?  Honestly, even "remaining here until the next unfortunate party finds our skeletons, locked in a passionate embrace in a lonely tower" would be a better idea.~
@1833 = ~Korin!  Shame on you!  Don't you have an ounce of romance under that thick ranger skull of yours?~
@1834 = ~(sigh) If only: my memory will remind me again and again, I am sure.~
@1835 = ~But this place is waiting.  Let us go.~
@1836 = ~<CHARNAME>, it's no secret that I harbor some hopes when it comes to you. Which is why "getting out of here" is my best chance - our best chance - of ever bringing them to life.  Don't you agree?~
@1837 = ~Nope.~
@1838 = ~No!  I hate waiting!~
@1839 = ~It sounds reasonable.  But when did "reasonable" and "romance" work well together?~
@1840 = ~Maybe.  But "right now" is always better, isn't it?~
@1841 = ~Never mind, then.~
@1842 = ~Are you sure?  I don't think you'll feel as inspired when we're wounded, exhausted and out of drinking water.~
@1843 = ~Sure about using this chance to get all romantic with you?  Absolutely.~
@1844 = ~Well, I feel fine now, and that's what matters.~
@1845 = ~Korin, stop stalling.~
@1846 = ~Not really.  But when did it stop us?~
@1847 = ~Just forget it, then.~
@1848 = ~I am not trying to stop you or stall you, <CHARNAME>.  I am...~
@1849 = ~Oh, what the hell.~
@1850 = ~(Korin's eyes suddenly shine dangerously, and he pulls you after him into a nook far enough from prying eyes.  As soon as you are alone, his lips find yours.)~
@1851 = ~(From his words, Korin hadn't kissed a woman in many months, but his lips don't belong to a man who spent the last years in solitude.  Rather, it's as if he's been mapping your mouth, your face and your body in secret, finding hidden lines and pinpoints of pleasure.)~
@1852 = ~(His hands travel all over your back, your hips, your breasts; your clothes become disheveled within moments, as his fingers find your naked skin.)~
@1853 = ~(His lips find your neck and travel down your cleavage, while his hand caresses your hair. You feel his pulse next to your heart before he takes you into his arms again, kissing you with fervor.)~
@1854 = ~(Finally Korin pulls away from your lips, breathless.)~
@1855 = ~<CHARNAME>, you're so beautiful...  I don't want to stop.  But we must get out of here, so... it is time.~
@1856 = ~Well... you've ravished me quite thoroughly, I admit.~
@1857 = ~You know, a walk in the moonlight would've been fine, too.~
@1858 = ~Stupid armor.  It always gets in the way.~
@1859 = ~But I want you.  Don't you want to...?~
@1860 = ~I'll keep it in mind.  Or perhaps a night in the moonlight, on silken sheets?  Somewhere warmer, though: these desert nights are freezing.~
@1861 = ~But... I am sorry if I have been too forward.  Rest assured, it won't happen again on this journey.~
@1862 = ~(Korin raises an eyebrow.)  Always?  Interesting.~
@1863 = ~You know I do.  You could see that I do, actually, if I was wearing... less.  But not here, not now.  And not while you are not completely sure.  I do not want our first night together to be a mistake.~
@1864 = ~Alas, I haven't even come close to the full meaning of the word.  But it's a start.~
@1865 = ~We really should conclude the mission soon.  The things I see when I look at you...~
@1866 = ~But I won't put you in danger again, however tempted I might be.  Let us return to the others.  Unless... you need my help to straighten your clothing?~
@1867 = ~A crazy thought, isn't it?  But it might be amazing, too - you never know until you try.~
@1868 = ~My parents traded with barbarian tribes.  Once or twice father even took me to the camp with him.  Needless to say, I was excited.  So many exotic things, smells and sights, pristine beauty of the tundra...~
@1869 = ~I might have wanted to stay there, yes.  But I had already met Arundel, and my heart belonged to the Tree.  If not, you might have met a fine valkyrie near Lonelywood!~
@1870 = ~A beautiful valkyrie indeed.~
@1871 = ~Oh, I'd tame her.~
@1872 = ~I think I prefer you as you are.~
@1873 = ~And would she attack me?~
@1874 = ~Don't be so sure.  We valkyries know how to deal with unruly men.~
@1875 = ~That would depend on your behavior... and your words.  A compliment or two might have mollified her, I think.~
@1876 = ~Regardless, the moment is gone.  I am what I am.  But isn't our current life wild and nomadic enough?  Adventurers, wanderers, travelers - and the tundra is just a stone's throw away.~
@1877 = ~I will miss this life when I settle down in Kuldahar.  Even if I'm well past sixty then, I'll still miss it.~
@1878 = ~Well, you have forty more years - let's not waste them!~
@1879 = ~Don't settle down till seventy, then.~
@1880 = ~But think of the advantages: a soft bed, a warm dinner, and some young idiot adventurers doing all the work!~
@1881 = ~Yeah, me too.  It's the best life there is, right?~
@1882 = ~I won't.  I actually want to settle down.~
@1883 = ~(Nella laughs.)  Indeed!~
@1884 = ~I might want a family one day.  It means different things to different people, having a family.  But to me it's mostly what I had with Arundel and what I'm learning to treasure with you: late-night talks, jokes over dinner, deep friendship and trust.~
@1885 = ~And making love.  Don't you forget making love!~
@1886 = ~What about certain wifely duties?  Otherwise your husband will be deeply disappointed.~
@1887 = ~Kids are nice, too.  Especially quiet ones.~
@1888 = ~Or just a happy home, a loving wife and some unruly children.~
@1889 = ~So we are a family?  I like the sound of that.~
@1890 = ~I value that, too.~
@1891 = ~Ooh, however did I forget to mention this very important part of married life?  Not on purpose at all, I'm sure.~
@1892 = ~Possibly.  If I am ready enough... wise enough.  I feel like I've only recently stopped being a child: I'll need time to learn that one day, I might become a mother.~
@1893 = ~Family, friends, companions...  My father once said that we all deserve the company we keep.  I am not sure I agree with him.  But if he was right...~
@1894 = ~If he was right, I feel privileged and honored that I deserve you.~
@1895 = ~I feel free - for the first time in many days, my eyes are open.~
@1896 = ~The air is different here.  The winds are milder - you breathe in and out and never notice it.~
@1897 = ~I am glad our journey brought us to Lonelywood, <CHARNAME>.  I have you to thank yet again.~
@1898 = ~There will be time enough for that later.  Tonight, for instance?~
@1899 = ~Your smile is the best reward.~
@1900 = ~I'm just glad you feel better.~
@1901 = ~(Nella laughs.)~
@1902 = ~You never give up, do you?  But I do not mind - not while there's this defenseless expression in your eyes, hidden well behind your smile.~
@1903 = ~Lonelywood feels almost like summer.  The snow is here, but the grass is not far away.~
@1904 = ~I'd like to sit with you in the grass - or in the water, as long as it's a warm brook, not a bitterly cold lake.~
@1905 = ~Or even pick flowers together.  Or...~
@1906 = ~I am losing my head with you, am I?~
@1907 = ~Not at all.  You're just in a cheerful mood.~
@1908 = ~Are you?  I haven't noticed.~
@1909 = ~Finally!  Let's be crazy together!~
@1910 = ~Maybe a little.~
@1911 = ~Oh, no.  You won't corrupt me this easily, <CHARNAME>!  The forces of nature will claim you!~
@1912 = ~Thank you.  It feels good to let my cares rest for a short while.~
@1913 = ~I think I shall pray now.  I wish to thank the gods for this day, for the sun, for your company.~
@1914 = ~Do not worry, I won't lag behind.  You go ahead.~
@1915 = ~I stand by your side, <CHARNAME>.  Always.  Whatever this madman is thinking of, he won't get away.~
@1916 = ~You're angry.  I like that.~
@1917 = ~Maybe in parts.  A leg will go here, a hand will go there...~
@1918 = ~Just don't do anything stupid.~
@1919 = ~You're an evil, evil man, <CHARNAME>... and I like it.~
@1920 = ~Oh, he may hope for that, but I'll stay perfectly calm, even as his dirty head comes off his shoulders.~
@1921 = ~I hate this feeling of being locked!  Nowhere to go, trapped in this castle like a lion in a cage, and this abominable Hobart fellow!  Ugh!  I want to break something.~
@1922 = ~Or kiss someone?~
@1923 = ~Why not?  Lots of old pottery around, too.~
@1924 = ~Be my guest.  This is enemy territory, remember?  Anything goes.~
@1925 = ~(sigh)  <CHARNAME>, you're incorrigible.  No... I'm too angry to be kissed.~
@1926 = ~I should probably restrain myself, or I'll become really angry and say something I'll regret and - it won't be good.  I don't want to lose our...~
@1927 = ~(Nella turns away suddenly, and you spot high color on her cheeks.  Then she takes a deep breath and turns back to you.)~
@1928 = ~<CHARNAME>... will you sit with me for a minute?  I have a gift for you.  'Tis a silly one, but I want you to have it now, before I break it in a fit of anger or something just as unseemly.~
@1929 = ~Of course, Nella, what is it?~
@1930 = ~A gift?  For me?~
@1931 = ~Sure, just relax.  Everything will be fine.~
@1932 = ~As long as you don't mistake me for a particularly tempting bit of pottery.~
@1933 = ~I scraped some bark from the Tree a while ago.  Here, it works like a fibula now: you can fasten your cloak with it, if you want.  It's shaped like the Tree, but it's only a coincidence... I think.~
@1934 = ~It's lost its healing qualities, but it has another enchantment, a small one.  If you ever get lost in the Dale, you'll always be able to find Kuldahar, if you simply touch the brooch.  It can serve like a compass: the tip closest to Kuldahar will always be warm.~
@1935 = ~Where did you get the idea for this?~
@1936 = ~Little good it does to me now, being trapped here.~
@1937 = ~A lovely gift.  Thank you.~
@1938 = ~Arundel gave me a twin of this brooch when I went on my first mission.  I'm keeping it on me still, though the enchantment is fading.  But it's his gift, and it is dear to me.~
@1939 = ~I know it has little use.  But it's a symbol.  As long as you have it, you can get back home.~
@1940 = ~Back home?  Or to your home?~
@1941 = ~To Kuldahar and to you?~
@1942 = ~(Nella looks straight into your eyes.)~
@1943 = ~Both, if you want.~
@1944 = ~Toy boats?  Right now?  Are you kidding?  It's a dream come true!~
@1945 = ~I loved floating toy boats with my father, especially in spring.  Silverymoon, Daggerford, even Westgate - although our pretty boats didn't survive there for long, with those rude mercenaries and their heavy boots everywhere, ugh!~
@1946 = ~So, what are you waiting for?  Come on, let's find some wood!  Not that I'm good at woodwork, but I can do a toy raft worth its salt.  Want one, too?~
@1947 = ~That would be nice of you.~
@1948 = ~Ha!  My canoe will beat your raft any day!~
@1949 = ~No, I want to make one myself.~
@1950 = ~Ho-ho! A challenge?  Bring it on!~
@1951 = ~Oh, I can't wait!  You and I, two finest captains in the Realms!  Just like old times... wait, we've never done it before.  But it feels like we have, doesn't it?  Feels like we've done lots and lots of things together.~
@1952 = ~Maybe one day you'll meet my father, and we could do a real regatta, the three of us.  What do you think?~
@1953 = ~Won't he break my arms for corrupting his only daughter?~
@1954 = ~Meeting your father?  Isn't it a tad early?~
@1955 = ~Why not?  Seems like a good idea.~
@1956 = ~He's a good man - well, elf.  I don't think you've got anything to be wary of - he knows I get in trouble, so he'll only thank you for looking out for me.~
@1957 = ~Mother, though... she can be formidable.  But she's kind, really.  Even a little shy.~
@1958 = ~<CHARNAME>, hey, don't look at me like that!  I'm not going to introduce you as my beloved or some such nonsense.~
@1959 = ~But you're my friend.  My good friend, maybe my best one... even if you marry someone else tomorrow.~
@1960 = ~I am not going to marry someone else, if you're wondering.~
@1961 = ~What if I married you tomorrow?~
@1962 = ~It's all right, Teri.  If our paths cross, I'll be happy to meet your parents.~
@1963 = ~You are my friend, too.  Still, the thought of meeting your parents is disquieting.~
@1964 = ~Not tomorrow, maybe.  But the day after tomorrow?  Or after-after tomorrow?  Winds change, you know.  Things change, too.~
@1965 = ~Given that Lonelywood only has a temple of Waukeen, and I was captured in another temple of this lovely goddess scant months ago, I wouldn't risk it.  I don't want to become a widow at the altar, you know.~
@1966 = ~Or for you to become a handsome grieving widower.  I want you all to myself... oh.  I didn't say that last bit out loud, did I?~
@1967 = ~Thanks.  They will want to meet you - if only because you're giving me the orders.  But, like I said, you've got nothing to be afraid of!~
@1968 = ~Unless they find out you've been stuffing me with chocolate.  THAT won't go well with my mother at all.~
@1969 = ~Message received.  Don't worry, I'll hide you good and proper if I see them coming.~
@1970 = ~So... how about we forget about my parents and just have simple, wonderful, uncomplicated fun?  I've made a small raft while we talked, by the way - here.~
@1971 = ~Ready?  The first stream you see is ours!~
@1972 = ~My hair?  MY hair?  My dark precious elvish tresses I just spent the entirety of two minutes grooming?  My lovely curls and ringlets, of which I have, well, none?~
@1973 = ~Ruffle away!~
@1974 = ~(Ruffle Teri's hair)~
@1975 = ~Good to know.  Now, what do we have here...~
@1976 = ~Too bad.  I changed my mind.  No ruffling for you.~
@1977 = ~Ha!  I've always known you were evil and only joined our good and noble party by mistake.  Well, then, guess what I'll reply the next time you ask?~
@1978 = ~Probably the same thing.  But it doesn't matter.~
@1979 = ~Hey, hey!  Ruffling, not pulling!  I'm delicate!~
@1980 = ~Although caressing is better.  Maybe braiding?  Do you think I'll look better with braids?  Oh, never mind, they'll probably twist my hairline into something impossible.~
@1981 = ~So, with this hair business out of the way, what DID you want to talk to me about?~
@1982 = ~Netherese art?  Politics in western Cormyr?  The haughty samurai of Kozakura?  Take your pick.~
@1983 = ~Just checking up on you.  You're a dangerous person when left to her own devices, you know.~
@1984 = ~I was about to confess my undying love, but after such base scrutiny...   Nope.  No confession for you.~
@1985 = ~Nothing, really.  Just enjoying your company.~
@1986 = ~The haughty samurai would be nice, except that I know something about them.  I guess they are... very loyal and would never ever betray you?  Um.~
@1987 = ~Let's pretend I said something clever instead, and you applauded politely and mentioned how much you enjoyed our conversation.~
@1988 = ~Oh, yes, I plan to take over the world seven times before each breakfast, don't you know?  But since you've come to check up on me, you probably do.~
@1989 = ~Good!  Or I'd answer with my own confession, then we'd quarrel about who loves the other more, and the day would likely end in tears and pulled hair.  And I like my hair very much, thank you.~
@1990 = ~I enjoy your company, too, <CHARNAME>.  In case it needed to be said.~
@1991 = ~And, really, what else needs to be said?  Sometimes a smile is enough - if it's the right smile.~
@1992 = ~When you smile like this, I know it's the right one.~
@1993 = ~Don't forget ruffling your hair.  Speaking of which...~
@1994 = ~Absolutely.~
@1995 = ~Oh!  Almost forgot!~
@1996 = ~(Laughing, Teri ruffles your hair.  She only takes a second - but judging by your scalp's sensations, there's a regular raven's nest on your head now.)~
@1997 = ~Now catch me if you can!~
@1998 = ~Too bad. I don't care.~
@1999 = ~No?~
@2000 = ~Why?~
@2001 = ~Is something wrong?~
@2002 = ~That's certainly a novel approach.~
@2003 = ~Pleeeease?  I kid you not, I'm literally dying.  Aaaah...~
@2004 = ~(Teri sits on the floor and looks at you with hope.)~
@2005 = ~(sigh) All right, all right.  Come on, there's a nice ledge nearby.~
@2006 = ~Not a chance.  I know this look.~
@2007 = ~(Teri turns large, pitiful eyes up at you.)~
@2008 = ~You... you evil, manipulating you!  All right, you win.  Let's do it.~
@2009 = ~Nope.  But I'll carry some heavier things from your backpack.~
@2010 = ~Maybe some other time.  But not now.~
@2011 = ~Thanks!  You're the best!  Well, almost!~
@2012 = ~My shoulders are killing me.  This backpack?  A master torturer invented it, make no mistake.  And there's a huge red welt right next to my perfect neck.~
@2013 = ~In other words, if I get to free my shoulders from this awful pack, and maybe receive a long, thorough massage, it'll be heaven.  Even if we'll run out of drinking water right afterwards.~
@2014 = ~A shoulder massage?  Well, why didn't you say so?  Come on, let's find some privacy.~
@2015 = ~All right, you've convinced me.  Let's go over there.~
@2016 = ~Sorry, Teri, not now.  Busy fighting for our lives here.~
@2017 = ~(Teri immediately brightens and drags you to a flat enough ledge some way from the group, where she spreads her winter cloak.)~
@2018 = ~(Turning her back to you, she disrobes to the waist, throws her shirt over her discarded backpack and lies down with a satisfied sigh.)~
@2019 = ~So... I am ready.~
@2020 = ~A fine display of efficiency, I see.~
@2021 = ~Your back is very... smooth and pretty.~
@2022 = ~Let's begin, then.  But I warn you, I am merciless.~
@2023 = ~Oh, you'll find out that I'm quick and efficient in other things, too.  I just... haven't tried them yet.~
@2024 = ~What can I say?  I like my back, too!~
@2025 = ~(As you start massaging her shoulders, Teri suddenly raises her head in apprehension.)~
@2026 = ~Ah.  Erm.  Um... you'll go easy on me, won't you?  A lone half-elven girl, completely at your mercy?~
@2027 = ~Depends on your behavior...~
@2028 = ~Is this gentle enough for you?..~
@2029 = ~Don't worry, I know what I'm doing...~
@2030 = ~Hmm?  Ohhh... yes.  Yes.  Exactly like this.  Mmm... you have such good hands...~
@2031 = ~(Kiss the nape of her neck)~
@2032 = ~(Continue massaging her back)~
@2033 = ~Feel better?~
@2034 = ~(Teri growls, but very softly, and there's a smile on her face.)~
@2035 = ~I'm going to stay here forever.  With you.  We just need to figure out what to do about the food... oh, yes, this is the exact spot, how did you know?  Mmm...  Wake me up if I fall asleep, will you?~
@2036 = ~All right, enough is enough. We have to go, Teri.~
@2037 = ~Too much of a good thing can be damaging, too.  Here's your shirt.~
@2038 = ~I'd like to, but there's a curious skeleton just around the corner.  I think he's trying to get a glimpse of your breasts, too.  What do you want me to tell him?~
@2039 = ~(Teri jumps immediately, covering herself with a shirt.)~
@2040 = ~What?  Where?  Where is the bastard?~
@2041 = ~<CHARNAME>!  You got me good and proper, but don't joke like that!  He could've... I could've...~
@2042 = ~Oh, never mind.~
@2043 = ~(sigh) You're a spoilsport.  But it feels so good I don't think I can refuse you even if you ask me to dance naked on the table.  So, don't ask.~
@2044 = ~(Teri quickly buttons her shirt and kisses you on the cheek before shrugging on a cloak.)~
@2045 = ~Thank you.  You know... even if you never ever tell me you love me, I'll always remember this moment and think you do.~
